		<h1>BASIS Flagstaff Senior Projects</h1>

		<p>Every year, hundreds of BASIS seniors work on senior projects of their own, allowing them to shape a new sense of independence, investigation, and professionalism. I created this site to archive the specific work from the BASIS Senior Projects of Flagstaff, Arizona. Each one of these students have dedicated three months to their respective projects, and they've pushed hard to make progress in these areas and advance both their own understanding of these topics and the progression of their respective fields within the small Flagstaff bubble. From working with the local hospital to lab research on strains of <em>S. mutans</em>, deep-diving into linguistic biases within the court system to adapting prosthetics for traditional martial arts, each student has selected a topic of their choice to pursue within this twelve-week time frame. And boy did they pursue.</p>

		<p>It has been a major honor to recognize all of these people as my fellow classmates from all the way back in the fifth grade. I've been able to grow alongside them for the past seven years, and I've gained so much experience, wisdom, and good memories. These are some of the most talented, dedicated, and hardworking people that I know, and I am glad to be able to preserve their hard work on this website.</p>

		<p>Without further ado, here are the project groups!</p>
