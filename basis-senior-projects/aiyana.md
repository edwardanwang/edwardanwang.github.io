### Abstract

Trauma-Informed Care (TIC) is an approach to healthcare that acknowledges how traumatic events and experiences all impact an individual mentally and physically. It focuses on making the medical environment into a safe place where individuals can receive help to reduce the effects of trauma, while taking into consideration that retraumatization can happen during an appointment. This is what health care personnel want to avoid and is one of the reasons why personnel use screening tools. If the screening turns up positive, then personnel can then take the appropriate steps to help the person as the screening provides a sort of safety barrier for patients and personnel. Because of this, the risk of retraumatization for patients and Secondary Traumatic Stress (STS) for healthcare personnel is decreased. Now that Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) as of 2023 is requiring screenings for Social Determinants of Health (SODH), TIC also falls into the screenings as Safety, one of the parts of the required screening, focuses on abuse. However, the SODH screenings don’t necessarily match up with the standards of TIC since some of the questions asked aren’t really “trauma-informed”, which is a big issue when dealing with patients who have a traumatic history. This also becomes an issue as the hospital is currently working to get TIC screenings as part of primary care, and if the SODH screening questions are not up to those standards TIC has set in stone, then retraumatization or a new set of trauma can occur. This is why the hospital wants to push for their TIC screenings to primary care personnel rather than the SODH screenings. Through the help of Northern Arizona Healthcare (NAH), I will be analyzing the TIC screenings that they provide for individuals and its benefits, and compare that to the SODH Screenings. With this analysis, my end product will be helping put together an article to publish to the Healthcare Quality and Safety Journal.

## Week 1: Introduction To “Analysis Of Trauma-Informed Care Screenings”
Aiyana W - **February 21, 2024 10:40 am**

Hello everyone!

Welcome to my introductory post for my project! I’m happy you decided to take the time out of your day to read about my project, so thank you! I really appreciate it as I’ve had to rewrite this project about 5 different times, and I’m happy to have finally settled on something that interests me and incorporates all of my interests into one project! So again, thank you!:)

### About Me:

My name is Aiyana W. W. I’m not gonna tell you about my star sign and MBTI, and how that makes me compatible with the project I’m doing. I may tell you a joke or pun though! When I’m not spending time at my job or working on my senior project, I’m usually drawing while listening to videogame osts and crime podcasts, or I’m playing some sort of videogame and getting really competitive in Mario Kart with my brother. I’ve been interested in the medical field and forensics for a very long time, and I love to talk about different crimes and heavily judge how the case was handled or the criminal itself (I can talk all day about it).

### About My Project:

As my project title states, I will be analyzing Trauma-Informed Care Screenings over at Northern Arizona Healthcare NAH) at the Flagstaff Medical Center. Trauma-Informed Care (TIC) is an approach to healthcare that acknowledges how much trauma impacts individuals both mentally and physically and trying to help them heal from their trauma. It takes into consideration that these appointments can retraumatize a patient on top of the risk of Secondary Traumatic Stress (STS). TIC has to be very careful knowing this fact and have to really make sure that the medical environment is a safe environment. This is why screenings are done for TIC before medical personnel evaluate a patient on the subject since not many patients want to talk about their trauma. My job is to analyze the screenings that NAH does and what the benefits are of it and NAH wants to incorporate it the screenings into primary care. However as of 2023, the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) mandated required screenings for Social Determinants of Health (SODH), which are environment conditions that affect a wide-range of factors in peoples’ lives. One of the factors the screenings look at is “Safety”, which does focus on abuse, but their screenings aren’t necessarily trauma-informed, creating an issue when talking to people who have a history of trauma. So, I will look into the SDOH screenings to see whether they are in fact “trauma-informed” based and compare it to the NAH screenings. The final product of this will be posting an article to the Healthcare Quality and Safety Journal of the findings with the help from my advisor Sedona S., an intern student at NAH, as well as other personnel working on this project.

## Week 2: Expansion Of Knowledge And A Busy Week Ahead!
Aiyana W - **February 27, 2024 12:08 pm**

Good morning/afternoon/evening (depending on when you read this) everyone! Welcome back to my blog and thank you for clicking on the second post! It’s been fun learning more about TIC and going over to NAH for small meetings to discuss the next steps of the projects being done there and even seeing the small office area that I get to use temporarily as I continue to work on my project! And once I do get my student ID for the hospital, I won’t have to rely on the others as much to let me into the building/access to the floors we need to get to for meetings.

### What I’ve Learned So Far:

* What EBP Tables are
* More about TIC and ACEs
* TIC and ACE approaches in a pediatric environment
* What the TIC Screening questions look like (in general, not at the hospital)
* What the SDOH (Social Determinants of Health) Screening questions look like

### What I’ve Done So Far:

So far, I’ve just been expanding my knowledge on what exactly trauma-informed care (TIC) is and trying to learn all that I can about it since it is sort of a broad topic. Trauma comes in many different forms and all situations will be different from one another in some form or another. I also looked more into ACEs (Adverse Childhood Experience (s)), and the impacts it has on children and adults. I’ve also started working on my Evidence-Based Practice Table (EBP) for the journals, readings, and other sources that I’ve been looking into on PubMed, Google Scholar, and Chrome that talk about TIC, (specifically the standards and some of the screenings either conducted or analyzed), ACEs in both children and adults, and how both TIC & ACEs screenings are performed and analyzed in a primary care environment. I’ve generally kept the time frame for these articles within the last 5 years (2019-2024) just so they’re more recent studies.

### What An EBP Table Is:

Evidence-Based Practice is using the best evidence currently together with clinical experience and values to patients to help guide current and future decisions for health care. Its sole purpose of EBPs is to improve care and safety for patients that is backed by public research. There are many different models for EBP that explain the steps for EBP projects and implementation, but they all generally follow the same principles in trying to close the gap between research studies and their implementation in real life scenarios to add a positive outcome. There are about 6 steps in the ARCC EBP Process steps, but all EBP models vary slightly from one another.

### What I’ll Be Working On This Week:

This week I’ll be working on re-editing my EBP Tables and creating a presentation on TIC. We (students interning at the hospital) met with a very nice lady, who used to work in the Quality Care Department and focused on EBP Tables and information analysis, over Zoom to discuss our EBP Tables (how to form them, what to look for when searching for articles, etc). I want to do some small edits and add more sources that would be useful for my research. For the presentation, I was asked to make one that would explain what TIC is as this will be used for 3 different things: my final presentation in May when presenting to the BASIS community, a presentation to the Quality Health group as they want to know more about what TIC is (they are aware of what TIC is, but don’t know all the details about it since TIC was something that became more prevalent after their time when they worked as nurses), and as the beginning presentation for the big presentation that will be presented to the Primary Care Personnel (PCPs), as the two individuals who made the screenings and presentation want to implement the screenings into primary care. I intend to have these both done by next Monday (03/04).These will be the two big things I will be primarily focusing on this week. On the side, I will also try making some interview questions for Brian C., one of the two individuals who developed the screening and will present it to PCPs, to ask along the lines of: “What is the current screening and how is it performed?; How was the current screening designed?; What happens when there is a positive screening?; and How did you get interested in Trauma Informed Care?”. I also want to expand into learning more about Secondary Traumatic Stress (STS).

Thanks for reading to the end (even if you skimmed it)! Sorry for no picture this week, but please stay tuned for next week’s update! :)

## Week 3: Interviews & Presentations
Aiyana W - **March 5, 2024 12:48 pm**

Hello, and welcome back to Week 2! Spring break is just around the corner, as well as more exciting things to come (exciting for me at least in regards to my project)! I’m glad how much this project has come along despite being added at the last minute. It may not seem like it is a lot compared to others, but I’m happy with all the progress, all the support I’ve received, and all of the information I’ve learned thus far!:)

### What I’ve Done So Far:

As I’ve stated in my last post, I’ve been re-editing my EBP Tables to make sure the sources I’m looking at are at least within the last 5 years, and any mini edits they may have needed. I’ve also added some more EBP Tables to the ones I already have, and I’ll keep adding more as the sources come to me. My presentation is also completed! It is a short presentation, so it didn’t take long to make anyways, but today was the due date, and it was edited by my advisor as well, so it’s good to use for the presentation to the Quality Care Nurses tomorrow. Aside from that, the other hospital students and I met with Keli O. on Thursday to go over how to interview someone and any tips in regards to it. It was a really fun and helpful meeting to attend! We learned a lot, and she helped us get started on some ideas for interview questions. From there, I was able to create more interview questions to ask Brian C. when I have an interview with him today! I got all of the goals I had set done this past week. There were only a few things to do, but it was a really productive week!

### What I’ll Work On This Week:

* CITI Training
* More EBP Tables
* Interview with Brian C.
* Making a table for evaluating other screening tools
* Presentation to Quality Care Nurses
* Meeting with Paula M.

The CITI (Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative) Training is a program that, as the name states, trains individuals in standards for research, ethics, compliance, and safety when conducting research with humans. I would’ve had it completed yesterday, but other things in life aside from the senior project were going on, so I’m going to finish the rest of it today. Like I stated previously, I’m going to make more EBP Tables with more resources I come across this week. Today this afternoon is my interview with Brian C., who is a SANE-A nurse that I have the opportunity to meet with to discuss TIC, and the maltreatment screenings that are wanting to be implemented into primary care. After that, I will be sent other currently known maltreatment screenings to make a table that compares all of them to evaluate whether the screenings are trauma-informed. It will definitely start out as a draft until it gets revised enough that it will better determine which screening is indeed trauma-informed. This one will probably extend into the following weeks after. Tomorrow, I will be presenting my presentation on TIC to the Quality Care Nurses, which is very exciting (but also nerve wracking)! I think it will go well though since it is a short presentation, and it’s not a lot to cover besides just the basics. Then finally this Thursday, the other hospital students and I will meet with Paula M. to go over IRBs and any other important information and support she may have for us.

It is a very busy and important week for me right before spring break starts, but I’m really excited for it! I’ll probably start going over to the offices they have for us more this week than I have been just so I can make sure everything gets done in time, and I’ll have better access to my advisor for any questions or discussions about everything. Thank you for reading, and I hope you stay tuned in for next week’s (or the week after) blog post! 🙂

## Week 5: Spring Break And Week 4 Update Pt. 1
Aiyana W - **March 19, 2024 11:42 am**

Good morning/afternoon/evening everyone! I didn’t do a post last week as I honestly wanted to enjoy my last high school spring break (even though I don’t really have to come to school anyways except for the days to blog), but I did have a nice break away. There isn’t much to report on for my break as I didn’t really do much. I traveled for a day, got further into a Stephen King book that I bought a few weeks ago, I got to draw and sketch some more, and catch up on some well deserved rest. I did work a little bit on my project with my EBP Tables, but other than that I just tried to relax, and take a break from everything.

### What I’ve Done the Week Before Spring Break:

*CITI Training*: I finally got this completed, so this is out of the way. It was pretty simple and the mini quizzes were fairly easy, but it was a lot of reading to do. I still have to complete the Student Module so I can eventually get my badge (if I even get it since it’s already March), but I’m still having issues with it popping up for me, so I’ll have to keep messing with it.

*EBP Tables*: I sent the tables I already had done to my advisor so she can review them, but I’m still looking for more readings to learn more about TIC as it seems to vary based on the environment the screening and care are in (same focus, just different approach is how I’d describe it, but then again TIC is pretty broad in general).

*Interview with Brian C.*: It was really fun and interesting to talk to him! I have plans to meet with him again to finish the interview because I had 20 ish questions to ask him and originally the interview was supposed to be about 30 minutes, but we ended up spending an hour talking. We only got through 10 questions since my questions ended up leading to follow-up questions, and he explained everything really well! I’ll be talking about this interview in a separate blog from this one since I learned a lot.

*Presentation to the Quality Care Nurses*: This was really fun too! I was very nervous when I went in because this was a more professional presentation, and I’ve never presented to important individuals like this before, so I was afraid of the impression I would make as a high schooler. At first, I didn’t think the QC group was that big because there were 4 nurses who came in in-person for the presentation, and 6 nurses on Teams, so I wasn’t too nervous, but still fairly nervous. The presentation went smooth aside from when I did fumble on words because as I said before, I was freaking out internally. At the end, they wanted the camera turned on, so they could see me and the other nurses in the conference room to ask questions, and then that’s when I realized there were +22 other nurses who joined on the call after I originally saw just 6, and that’s when all my calmness went away (so it was good I didn’t see how many actually attended). After answering some questions to the best of my ability, I got a lot of compliments and reassurance about the presentation, and they all thought the presentation was really informative, which was my intended goal, so I’m glad they thought it was.

*Meeting with Paula M.*: This meeting was really informative about IRBs, and whether or not we needed them. With her help, I got to submit a little IRB to the hospital as a safety precaution just in case since mine didn’t really need it. The process was very simple too and  Paula M. helped me through it when I needed help.

*Meeting with Alejandra F.*: We (the students interning at the hospital) had a virtual meeting with Alejandra to talk about using Excel for implementing data, and just a quick overview of how to use Excel for future uses.

### What I’ll Work on This Week:

I’ll continue working on my EBP Tables, and creating more just to broaden my knowledge. Also, just for fun because TIC is really interesting to learn about. Even though most of the sources practically talk about the same thing, sometimes I’ll find new information that I hadn’t previously considered or just something completely new to me. Another thing I’ll be working on is creating a table to compare all the screening questions to see which ones are trauma-informed and which ones aren’t. I sort of started making an excel sheet to place them all in, but 2 screenings I’m still trying to look for, and I’m still trying to figure out how to compare them all.

Thanks for reading, and soon I’ll upload the second blog post about my interview, and what I learned from Brian C.! See y’all in the next post!

## Week 5: Spring Break & Week 4 Update Pt. 2
Aiyana W - **April 3, 2024 9:56 am**

Good morning/afternoon/evening everyone! This blog post is part 2 of last week’s post just to talk about my interview Brian C. He is a SANE-A nurse that I had the opportunity to talk to about TIC in the ER and the maltreatment screening that he and Shawn B. created that they presented to the Primary Care group on the 20th that I’ve mentioned in previous blogs before. Brian C. to explain and convince them (he did an amazing job and got right to the point with it). I hope to meet with him again to continue the interview since we only got through about 10 of the 21 I had wanted to ask him. I tried arranging my questions in a way that they would lead into one another in case I didn’t have any side questions to ask him as part of the original question. He explained everything very well and in detail, showing how passionate he was about TIC and his role as a SANE-A Nurse. It was really fun to talk with him, and we spent an additional 30 minutes talking.

### What I Learned:

He became a SANE nurse after working and talking to patients who have experienced trauma, as well as working over at the Northern Arizona Care and Services After Assault (NACASA). He mentioned how having conversations with patients sort of takes away the stigma that comes with any case, and how much of a difference it makes.

The process of becoming a SANE-A nurse is different from a SANE-P Nurse. Both require you to become a nurse first of all, and all the proper training for that. Then, you spend 40 hours doing clinical training that allows for practice, observation of other nurses and doctors, and just in general how to do everything. After that, then you’d complete an exam on everything that you’ve learned, though the difference comes in on this portion, as well as the clinical training because SANE-A Nurses focus on mainly adults while SANE-P Nurses focus on pediatrics or in other words, children. Brian C. mentioned that there aren’t many clinical exams for these cases in the area as there’s probably around 120-150 cases per year, which seems like a lot, but at a larger scale it isn’t as many. He also stated that you don’t have to be a SANE in order to provide TIC, and that anyone can be trauma-informed.

When I asked the question about any “triggers”, both verbal and non-verbal cues, that he looks for in order to decide whether or not to do the screening, he started off with saying that the patients are treated like patients first before anything, and that they can’t just immediately start bombarding the patient(s) with questions. All patients get screened no matter the reason they’re in the ER as anyone, no matter the age, can have something traumatic happen to them, so you can’t exclude just because YOU think they don’t need to be. You have to build a human interaction and connection with the patient because you’re a stranger to that patient, so you can’t just casually start questioning everything. One thing I thought was interesting was when he started talking about the body language and tone of the person screening. He said that the nurses and doctors themselves have to be careful with how they enter the room, their body language, demeanor, everything because the patient needs to feel comfortable, as well as feel that they’re in a safe place. It can also affect how willing that person is to talk with you, and open up about what’s going on. You also NEVER apologize for asking the questions. After that, then you focus on the complaint (the reason they’re in the ER) the patient has, and the proper care for them. After that, then you can start the screening, which has two sections: questions you ask the patient and tips for the medical personnel reading them, and a section that looks at physical things like any visible injuries. Some of the cues he looks for are body language, the person’s demeanor, and how they’re interacting with the person in the room with them (if there is a person in there with the patient).

Brian C. stated that there wasn’t a previous screening before the one that he and Shawn B. made. There wasn’t a policy at the time, meaning it couldn’t be validated. They wanted to make a screening that was short and fast as it is the ER, and many people come in everyday, so they needed something that worked with the fast paced environment. There are 6 main questions and 4 behavior questions (for the medical personnel). The questions are open-ended with some yes or no questions. They also made a question that aims to see whether the case was domestic violence, trafficking, or sexual assault. From there, depending on the response the patient gives, it helps pave the way for what the case may be if it does fall under one of those 3 cases. The other questions also help narrow things down as well for medical personnel, and slowly break down those walls that patients may have up.

The maltreatment screening also doesn’t screen for SDOHs because one, it was made before CMS made it a requirement for screenings, and 2, they can’t really screen for SDOHs in the ER because it’s the ER, and they’re focused on helping the patient then and there. It’s also a fast-paced environment as I’ve stated before so they can’t spend so much time screening the patient for things that have nothing to do with the injuries, if that’s the case.

Shawn B. and Brian C. went through at least 10-20 drafts before making their current screening, which is crazy, but also shows how dedicated the 2 were in wanting to make sure the screening was trauma-informed. The screening was added about 6 years ago with years of combing through literature to have evidence-based support to back it up. It also allowed the 2 to eliminate questions that were too specific, and find and create ones that were more broad and general.

Each of the sections (questioning and physical/behavior) have points, which the amount varies from question to question. If the scoring is over 10, then it’s considered a positive screening. Since some of the questions are “yes and no”, it helps eliminate any grey areas in the screening, and just to clarify, POSITIVE DOESN’T EQUAL ABUSE. As I’ve mentioned, trauma is a broad term and doesn’t mean it falls under one specific area. Brian C. advises just to trust the screening tool at the moment, and then follow up with other personnel on the matter as “Nurses have poor judgment”. It’s not bad, but it’s still good to get other opinions on the matter, and still make that report to maybe the Department of Child Services (DCS) or another organization to record the findings just so those organizations can follow up on it later if necessary.

The case for a positive screening, of course, varies patient to patient. There are a few things medical personnel will do first before fully acting on the case. They’ll consider how recent the injury had happened (if it’s an injury) because if they need to go into surgery then they need to focus on that first of all. They also consider the level of threat to the patient, and if the medical personnel believe it’s a high risk, then the police will get involved or if the patient needs immediate safety. In the case of children, they won’t tell the patient about the findings, and immediately get police involved, as well as DCS, especially for the long-run. With adults, it’s a bit different because as mandatory reporters, medical personnel have to report if there is a safety concern. After that, they state the patient’s rights and give a choice to the patient on what they want to do, getting them involved in the decision, and not just the nurse or doctor deciding for them. Once a decision has been made, then the medical personnel can connect the patient with an advocate/community advocate (like Victim Witnesses for example), so their advocate can help the patient through their journey.

In the case of when the person who came in with the patient won’t leave, you must first read the room to see how the patient is interacting with that person(s), as well as the level of threat. You can seek other opportunities during the patient’s time in the ED when the patient is alone to ask. It’s very important that the questions are asked in private. If the person absolutely refuses and the level of threat is high, then the police or security will be called.

Another case when minors or children are involved, there are different screenings for different age groups (0-8 months, 9 months-4 years, 5 years-11 years, 12 years-17 years, and 18 years & older). For 0-8 months, 0 is a negative screening, 5-10 is awareness, and anything above 15 is a positive screening, but it’s still recommended to get the opinions of others. It’s sometimes hard to screen for 5 years-11 years because those ages are in an area where the personality and maturity levels change, and vary. Based on literature, a majority of abuse happens between the ages 9 months-4 years old because children are still learning to talk, but also the years where children are very active as they start to walk and tumble as they learn to walk, making bruises more common and an easier way to hide inflicted injuries. It becomes concerning if there are +3 bruises or bruises in random spots other than the area injured.

Sorry this one was a pretty long one, but there was a lot to talk about and write about since I learned quite a bit from that single interview alone! Thank you for reading through the whole thing (if you did), and I hope you’ll keep up with my blog! See you next week!

## Week 6: Excel Sheets And Tables
Aiyana W - **March 27, 2024 11:53 am**

Good morning/afternoon/evening everyone…again! This is this week’s official blog post! Thank you for keeping up with the blogs so far! I’ll try to keep this one somewhat short since there isn’t much that I had to do last week, and mainly I just have things I plan to do in the future, though it’s not guaranteed to happen this week.

### What I’ve Done So Far:

Like I’ve stated previously, I’ve been making EBP Tables on different articles about TIC mainly, and recently some on Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) (which I’ve defined down below) because the other screenings I’m looking at include these as part of their screening process. I’m trying to learn what specifically goes into each category for SDOHs because it seems in some articles, they are broken down further than the main 5 domains on the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) website. An example being that some articles group “Food” into the  “Neighborhood and Built Environment” domain like it is on the CMS website while some make “Food” its own separate domain. As I mentioned in the previous post, the maltreatment screening used at the hospital, specifically in the Emergency Department (ED), the screening doesn’t include SDOHs besides the “Safety” domain. Brian C. and Shawn B. were able to get the screening implemented into Inpatient Care (just to clarify, this is NOT Primary Care in case there was confusion), which the nurses there have been using, and have said good things about it, though I’m not sure how different the screening is compared to the ED. Speaking of Shawn B. and Brian C., the presentation to the Primary Care (PC) team was successful! They liked the idea of using the screening, and now they just need to figure out how to make it work within the PC environment, as well as including SDOH questions as required by CMS. I’ve also started making the tables to compare the screenings (which I’ll state below) to one another on 2 different Excel sheets, both comparing different things between the screenings. The sheets aren’t comparing the questions on whether or not they’re trauma-informed…yet. I’m still trying to figure that part out on how I’ll do it. And finally…FINALLY I got my badge to get into buildings now! I originally thought I needed to do the Student Module to get it, but I guess not, so I went in to take a picture and get the badge made. It was a very quick process, and I feel official now with it lol.

### Social Determinants of Health (SDOH):

SDOHs, according to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS), are “the conditions in the environments where people are born, live, learn, work, play, worship, and age that affect a wide range of health, functioning, and quality-of-life outcomes and risks” (Medisolve, 2022). They impact someone’s well-being, as well as their ability to follow their treatment track. There are 5 domains that HHS has to track the different conditions.

*5 Domains:*

* *Economic Stability*: “A patient’s financial resources, including income, employment, housing stability, and food security.” (Medisolve, 2022)
* *Education Access & Quality*: “A patient’s ability to access and advance their lives through education, from early childhood to higher education.” (Medisolve, 2022)
* *Healthcare Access & Quality*: “A patient’s access to and understanding of health care, including primary care access, insurance coverage, and health literacy.” (Medisolve, 2022)
* *Neighborhood & Built Environment*: “The quality of where a patient lives, including air and water quality, crime rates, access to healthy food, and more.” (Medisolve, 2022)
* *Social & Community Context*: “A patient’s relationships with friends, family, co-workers, and the community, which can be impacted by issues like discrimination, abuse, and incarceration.” (Medisolve, 2022)

### Excel:

*Sheet 1: Things About the Screenings*

* Screening Name
* Date
* \# of items/questions
* How long it takes to screen
* What health department does the screening
* Population
* Methods of screening

*Sheet 2: SDOH Domains*

This sheet sees which domains the screening questions fall into, and whether they cover all domains or just some. For this sheet, I included “Transportation” because I wasn’t sure which of the domains it would fall into since the definitions provided above don’t mention “Transportation”.

### Screenings:

I’m going to be comparing 6 different screenings:

* ER Maltreatment Screening
* PRAPARE
* American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP)
* Heath Begins
* CMS AHCM HSRN
* Virginia Commonwealth University Health System: Social Needs Assessment

### What I’ll Be Doing This Week & Future Plans:

This week is still making more EBP Tables, but mainly I’ll be focusing on the Excel sheets for comparison. I hope to soon figure out how to determine whether or not the questions are trauma-informed or not, but I’ll be working more with my advisor to help me with that.

Future plans will be scheduled for another interview with Brian C., so we can continue where we left off last time, as well as meeting with 2 other individuals who work in TIC. I also plan to meet with an Inpatient Nurse who has used the maltreatment screening just to see how it’s working for the team, and if they have any suggestions for improving it (if anything). I hope to work on what to do with a positive screening in PC, and how that process will work since the PC environment is different from the ED’s in what they have access to.

Thanks again for reading, and I hope you continue to follow along with my blog!

## Week 7: SBAR Sheets & Meetings
Aiyana W - **April 3, 2024 9:50 am**

Good morning/afternoon/evening everyone! Welcome back to another week of my blog! Thank you for keeping up with all of them so far (if you have that is)! I know I mentioned last week I was going to have 2 blogs, but it’s for sure going to be this week (I did edit last week’s blog so it wouldn’t be confusing…sorry!). This blog post should also be short while the second one will be fairly long, so please bear with me!

### What I’ve Done So Far:

I took a break from the EBP Tables to primarily focus on making my excel sheets, and adding more to those tables. In my post last week, I talked about what I planned to put in each sheet, so that’s what I’ve done with those. It definitely helped keep information organized for me so it was easier to look at, and compare that way. I also added a section to the second sheet that looked at the style of the question. This just means I was seeing which screenings used “yes/no”, “most likely/least likely”, etc. This helps to see if the questions are open-ended or restricted to a specific time frame (months, years, etc), or restricted to a certain number of items to choose from. I also met Shawn B. to get an idea of what I should start doing now as it was very hard to figure out how to compare the screenings I had mentioned in my last post. Each screening was designed for a certain medical environment, and designed for different things. The screening in the ED is specific to the ED and doesn’t include SDOH questions, while the other screenings didn’t have as many “Safety” Domain questions. This sort of put me in a position where I was unsure on what to do, and where to go from there. Talking with Shawn B. helped give me a sort of direction to go in. She suggested I make a SBAR sheet (I’ll write down below what it stands for) for each screening to help me analyze each of the screening questions, and write why or why not the question is trauma-informed. I started making a SBAR sheet for the PRAPARE screening (mentioned in the last post) since it was one of the shorter screenings (I had each screening printed so it made it easier to look at). Other than that, there wasn’t much more I worked on besides those 2 things this past week.

**S- Situation** (what’s the current situation/problem)

**B- Background** (what’s the background on said situation)

**A- Analysis** (what you analyzed about the situation)

**R- Recommendation(s)** (what you recommend to possibly help this situation)

### What I’ll Be Doing This Week:

This week I plan to keep on working the SBAR sheets primarily as I know those will take time to write down, and complete. Since I was gone these last few days, I missed the regular check-ins we have with Floye B., so I will be meeting up with her this Friday to talk about what I’m currently working on now, and what the next steps will be for my project. Also on Friday, I have another meeting with Floye B. (advisor), Sedona S. (advisor), and Shawn B. (RN) to discuss getting a build for the maltreatment screening that works for Primary Care (PC), CHC, and BH. It’s to get an idea of the vision for what it may look like, and key stakeholders it may have. I don’t know how big of a role I will have at this second meeting, but it will still be fun to attend, and see what input Shawn B., and Sedona S. have for it. I still plan to do all the other things I mentioned I wanted to do in my last post, but I don’t have any set dates in place yet. Hopefully I do get time to do these things in the future before our projects are due. Only 5 more weeks! Which seems like a long time, but in reality it isn’t as these last few weeks are flying by quickly!

Hopefully this post was a bit shorter than the last few…at least a little bit as today’s other post will be longer. Thank you again, and see you next week!

## Week 8: S-BAR, Meetings, & Presentations
Aiyana W - **April 10, 2024 10:05 am**

Good morning/afternoon/evening everyone! Another week has come and gone, and we’re getting closer and closer to our final presentations. It’s been a simple last few days as nothing too big happened, so this post should be fairly short. I’m just glad I got my post done, and posted for the week of Spring break (sorry for having you guys read 2 posts last week)!

### What I’ve Done So Far:

As I mentioned in the first post from last week (not the one talking about the interview with Brian C.), I’ve been creating S-BAR Sheets for each of the screenings I’m analyzing. There are 6 screens in total, not including the one from the ER, that I’m looking at, and the process takes awhile to do. For the “Background” Section of the S-BAR, I wrote notes on trauma-informed care (TIC), including terms, and notes on Social Determinants of Health (SDOH), and terms as well to give some background on what I’m specifically looking for. I also research more on the screening, and any information that can help me better understand what the survey/screen focuses on. This is one of two parts that makes the process long because I have to read through the websites that talk about the screenings, and pick out any important information in regards to that screening. The other part that takes a while is the actual analysis of the questions itself. I moved from looking at all the questions to just looking at the questions that fall into the “Safety” Domain. It made the process go a little bit faster, but it still takes a minute to do. I plan to have all 6 done by Thursday (tomorrow) because I’ll be meeting with Floye B., Sedona S., and Alejandra F. to go over 4 different things:

* What CMS is looking for for SDOH Screenings
* Review all the screenings
* Which questions address Abuse/Trafficking
* If the questions are trauma-informed

The meeting I mentioned that I had with Shawn B., Sedona S., and Floye B. went well, and it led to Floye B. and I combining Brian C.’s presentations on TIC (the one for the Quality Care Nurses) and the ER/ED’s screening to be used as part of a teaching presentation for other organizations to use in part of their training for using the ER’s screening. The presentation will be an audio recording one. Sort of like a webinar. Floye B. and I started combining the two presentations this past Monday, so I just have to go in and edit a few things.

### What I’ll Be Doing This Week:

As I mentioned above, I’ll be meeting with 3 people tomorrow to go over the 4 things mentioned in the bullet points. I’ll also continue making the S-BAR Sheets, and edit the presentation I explained above. From there, I’ll figure out more details about the next steps in what we’ll be doing. Other than that, I’ll start putting together my own presentation for our final presentations using the presentation I already made for the Quality Care Nurses a while back.

Thank you again for reading my blog! See you next week!

## Week 9: Another Week Closer
Aiyana W - **April 18, 2024 11:22 am**

Hello everyone! Welcome back to another week of blogs. We’re another week closer to finishing, and presentations! I’m actually quite nervous, and a little sad that we’re nearing our final weeks on the projects. This was a fun, and exciting experience to have gotten the opportunity to do, and I will miss everyone I’ve been able to work with. This one should also be a shorter blog as well today, but thanks for following along so far!

### What I’ve Been Doing So Far:

I finally got all the S-BARS done for each of the different screenings, so those are all done and completed. Those took the longest so far just because there’s a lot to add depending on the source. Some screenings had more information on it and the company that made it than some others. Depending on time and whether or not my advisors want me to, I may look back at the other domains to see if they are “trauma-informed” or not, but that isn’t a sure task I’ll be doing. It could provide some insight, but that’s not the primary focus of doing the analysis. I’ve briefly started on my presentation, but it’s something I know I will need to get a move on with soon, even though it wasn’t my main focus, and not the main thing that I needed to get done. I did meet with Floye B. and Sedona S. to go over the screenings, and all my findings, which was quite a bit, and a little surprising. One of the screenings I looked at didn’t have a “Safety” domain, another barely had 2, a majority of them were not “trauma-informed”, and a common thing I noticed was that most questions are based off the HITS questions, which I’ll explain below. They then wanted me to make an 2 Excel sheet to make a comparison between each screening based on strengths, weaknesses, and an overview. I also included a rating system out of 10 points for each. The other was for comparing questions, but the file didn’t save so I will have to redo it.

**HITS Questions:** Questions made specifically to address domestic violence cases, but aren’t “trauma-informed”.

**H- Hurt** (Does your partner hurt you?)

**I- Insult** (Does your partner insult you?)

**T- Threaten** (Does your partner threaten you?)

**S- Scream** (Does your partner scream at you?)

### What I’ll Be Doing:

Sometime in the future, Floye B. and I will attend a meeting with Victim Witness to go over the referral for the maltreatment screening, which hopefully will be soon, and it is pretty exciting to meet with them! I need to edit my Excel sheets a bit because 1 of them didn’t save as I explained above, so I do really want to get that done. I might switch it to a Google Doc and do it there so it’s a bit more organized (and so I can actually do bullet points). My final product will be my comparisons between the screenings and the pros and cons of each screening. It will also be about the CMS’s SDOH and the critique on that.

Thanks for reading, and see you next week!

## Week 10: Final Planning
Aiyana W - **April 24, 2024 6:47 pm**

Good morning/afternoon/evening everyone! This past week wasn’t too busy, so again like last week’s post, this blog post is going to be short as well.

### What I’ve Done So Far:

I did finally edit the excel sheets I made by switching them over to Google Docs so I could one, add bullet points and 2, add more to the strengths and weaknesses. When I did do the excel sheets, I kept it simple just because you can’t do bullet points, and making a list took up a lot of space. Excel is also hard to use in general for someone like me who hasn’t used it until this year and this project specifically. For the excel sheet that I thought was saved but in reality didn’t, I just used the question analysis that I made in the S-BAR instead. It pretty much had the same information that the lost excel sheet had (overview, strengths, and weaknesses). I’m also starting to put all my findings together so I can start putting it into my final power point.

### What I’ll Be Doing:

We still plan to meet with the Victim Witness office as I mentioned in my last blog post, but there hasn’t been a set date and time for when that will be happening. Next Monday, we (hospital students) will have an overview meeting at the hospital to practice our presentations, and make sure that we know how the projector works and how to flip through the slides. I think we will be having a group meeting this week at some point, but that hasn’t been scheduled yet either. Aside from putting together my final presentation power point, I’m deciding whether I should make a side presentation or just a paper to talk about things like:

* Positives of using TIC
* Negatives for TIC
* How the hospital’s screening applies

This is only part of what I plan to talk about, but I’ll check in with my advisors to see which would be better. Or I can just include it in my final presentation, but I might make a paper to put all of my findings together. It might follow along the lines of a research paper, but it just depends on time since we have only two-ish weeks left for our projects. My final product will still be the same as what I mentioned last week as well.

That’s all for this week’s post, but thank you and I hope to see you in the next post!

## Week 11: Second To Last Week…
Aiyana W - **April 30, 2024 9:50 pm**

Hello everyone! Welcome to the blog’s second to last post! It’s the last week before presentations, which is both exciting and a tad scary because it’s the last week to get everything together. I hope this blog was interesting to read over these couple weeks, and that you all enjoyed reading it!

### What I’ve Done So Far:

Primarily, I’ve been trying to get my presentation together and finalized because there’s so much I want to talk about, but not enough time to talk about it. Also trying to reorganize and edit things to make it flow has been the big thing. Tomorrow is my practice presentation, so I really need to make sure it’s all finalized. Yesterday, we did a quick Teams meeting with Floye B. to see if there’s anything else we need, and then we met up with her later to see what the auditorium we will have our presentations in is at, and how everything was going to work. I am still putting together the positives and negatives paper I mentioned last week because I want to make sure I do have it all down, but I’m still deciding if I want to add it to my final presentation or not since it’s not my main focus. Yesterday I also met with Victim Witness (V.W.) to ask questions to help give the hospital and Primary Care an idea of when to call V.W., and just other information that may help. It was an interesting meeting and very informative, so now I’ll just put a small paper together for my advisors to summarize the information.

### What I’ll Be Doing:

As I stated before, my main focus is finalizing the presentation, and making sure I have all of my notes together to practice. I’ll also be finalizing anything else I need done (papers, excel sheets, etc), so it can all be submitted to my advisors to use as they continue this project later. I may still try to help out with the project after everything is said and done, but it will mainly depend on my schedule these following weeks. Next week is presentation time! Mine is one of the first ones, so that’ll be fun!

Thank you again to everyone reading this, and all the people I got to meet and work with! This has been an amazing experience, and I had a really fun time doing it! I learned so much in these last few weeks, and I’m glad I got to help out with all of my research! See y’all in the final post!

## Week 12: The End
Aiyana W - **May 9, 2024 3:51 pm**

Hello everyone, and welcome to this blog’s final post! It has been an amazing adventure being able to do all of this research and compile it all together for the finale! Thank you to everyone who continued to read this and ask amazing questions! I really enjoyed reading everyone else’s blogs and seeing their progress as the weeks go by! I’m a little sad that now this is all over, and we’ll be graduating soon, but again thank you to everyone, and I’m excited to see everyone’s presentations!

I guess I don’t really have to section my blog anymore since there isn’t much I’ll be doing afterwards now that I already presented yesterday, so I guess I’ll talk about that and put my findings into one place for this last blog. 

### Presentation:

The presentations went really well last night! I went last out of my group, and I really enjoyed listening to them talk about their projects! Everyone was very passionate about it, and even made a few jokes here and there throughout. I went through a phase while waiting for my turn where I would feel fine and confident and then get anxious and worried, and then back to being fine again. I felt pretty confident when I presented and thankfully made it within the time slot, but I did start to get nervous towards the end when people were asking questions…and there were a lot. I mainly got nervous because I didn’t want to say the thing I want to say the wrong way or make it sound like I was an expert in all of this because I’m not. I’m quite knowledgeable from everything I’ve learned, but that doesn’t mean I could go to a clinic and help someone ( I would get happy internally when I would see Shawn B., who works with TIC constantly, nodded when I said something, so I knew I was saying something right). I also wanted to make sure it made sense what I was talking about as well, and not leave someone confused. It was really nice to receive flowers from Delaney F., and a card from Floye B. and Paula M. at the end of our presentations. It was really nice of them to do that for us, and I appreciated it wholeheartedly! :))

### Findings/Final Product:

I mentioned in a previous post I believe that I made a scoring system in order to give each screening a score. While it might not be the best way to “rate” it, it’s good for the short-term until a better one is made. I did it based on the Safety Domain mainly and looked at 3 main things: generalizations, language, and # of questions. 

Generalizations: Does it apply to/use the term “anyone”? Or does it only apply to a specific group/individual?
* Specific – 1 pt
* General – 3 pt

\# of Questions: How many questions are in the Safety Domain?
* 0-3 questions – 1 pt
* 4-6 questions – 2 pt
* +7 questions – 3 pt

Language: Are the questions trauma-informed?
* No – 1 pt
* 50/50 – 2 pt
* Yes – 3 pt

I’ll post the link to my power point, but to summarize it, most of the questions were not trauma-informed. This is a big concern, and not the kind of questions you would want to ask a patient who may have experienced some sort of trauma in their life. My final product was just the comparisons between the screenings, and their strengths and weaknesses. I will also provide the link for my presentation as well, which goes into more details!

### Power Point:

I’d like to thank all of my advisors who have helped me along the way, and all of the amazing people who contributed to making this both successful and possible. And thank you again to all of you who kept up with the project! I guess I can’t really say “see you in the next blog” anymore…so I guess I’ll be seeing you!
