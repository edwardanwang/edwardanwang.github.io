# Language Barriers and Bias in Court; How Do We Dispel Linguistic Bias?

**Internal Advisor:** Amy Green
**External Advisor:** Elissa Gonzalez-Olson (Intern Coordinator)
**Internship Location:** Coconino County Attorney's Office

### Abstract

As an intern at the Coconino County Attorney's Office, my research focus delves into the pervasive issue of language bias within the legal system. In the realm of law, each word holds immense significance, serving as the building blocks to provide a comprehensive understanding of a case and aiding jurors in reaching informed decisions. However, this intricate process poses significant challenges for individuals who do not have English as their first language or lack fluency in the language. While interpreters may be available, the translation of every word may not always be precise, exacerbating the need for effective solutions to address this systemic issue. Moreover, the presence of linguistic bias further compounds the complexity of legal proceedings. A notable example is the George Zimmerman case, wherein the testimony of the primary prosecution witness was undermined due to her African American Vernacular English (VVAE) accent, ultimately influencing the jury's decision and deeming her account to be not credible. These inadvertent biases underscore the urgency to scrutinize and rectify linguistic and translational challenges within the legal framework. Throughout my internship, I aspire to investigate and propose remedies for these inherent biases, with the ultimate goal of fostering a fair and equitable legal system for all individuals, irrespective of language or accent.

## Introduction To “Language Barriers And Bias In Court; How Do We Dispel Linguistic Bias?”
Dain Y - **February 21, 2024 10:40 am**

When we talk about racial bias or profiling, usually, visual racial profiling is the first kind of bias that comes to mind. However, another equally prominent issue is linguistic profiling which brought about due to bias in auditory cues and accents of one’s speech.  

Hello, my name is Dain Yi and I will be researching the effect of linguistic profiling and/or bias in the court and specifically, on the jury.

Though I have had a focused interest on STEM throughout most of my time in High School, funnily enough, I recently had a complete flip of interests and gained an interest in law and policy which was driven by my hope to advocate for issues in our society. Additionally seeing firsthand how one’s accent can be a cause of discrimination in my life as a child of two immigrant parents from South Korea, I have also had an interest in DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) along with accents.

Previous background I have had in DEI was through the publication of a paper, “High school students’ attitudes towards diverse cultures and ethnicities”, in which I conducted empirical research on 67 High Schooler’s to study how diversity affects our understanding and perceptions of people around us. Now, combining my interests in DEI as well as law, I made the decision to delve into how this form of linguistic bias has been and can be seen in courts, where the issue of racial bias can be detrimental towards the results of a case.

During my internship, I will be interning with Ms. Elissa Gonalez-Olsen. Ms. Elissa Gonalez-Olsen is head of the Coconino County Attorney’s Office’s Internship Program, which is a program for junior and senior college students from Northern Arizona University (NAU) and Coconino Community College (CCC).

## Week 1: The First Day
Dain Y - **February 28, 2024 10:50 am**

Hello Everyone!

This week was my first official day interning at the Coconino County Attorney’s Office. For these first couple of weeks my main goal will be to get to see all of the different aspects of the legal process in detail from sorting mail of cases and media files to getting to know how attorneys prepare for and carry out cases. Along with this, I will also attend as many court observations as I can alongside someone in the Attorney’s Office in both the Justice and Superior Courts.

I was first given a tour of the office and got to briefly meet one-on-one with all the attorneys, paralegals, and employees; however, I am planning to meet longer with each individual in the future in order to gain an introduction to their work and the different areas of law that each individual specializes in.

I was then given some housekeeping tasks in order to set up an official email and accounts with the Coconino County system, one of which included a software system called PROSECUTORbyKarpel (PbK). PbK is a case management software for Prosecutors that allows for anyone in the legal profession to easily search cases / clients / victims’ information as well as all of the supporting files and evidence that is attribute to the individual/s.

Next, I took two different trainings and tests assigned from the County IT Service Team on how to identify Social Engineers and on general Cyber Security. Law firms in general are very susceptible places for potential hackers whose goal may be theft or ransom to employees at the firm. And as law firms handle sensitive and confidential information about their clients, I was taught how important it is to uphold the security there.

Finally, I was able to meet with both the front office / mail sender, Ms. Liz, as well as the Media Redaction Specialist, Mr. Wade. Ms. Liz, who is also called the “gate-keeper” of the firm, links clients with their attorneys, receives then scans and uploads information to PbK, and gives clients updates of their cases among other things. Mr. Wade takes all audio, video, and picture files and edits them by redacting information such as a victim’s name, address, workplace, and more. In videos, he redacts confidential images of items such as one’s drivers license that may have been present at the scene of an auto accident. Additionally, when attorney’s need specific shorter clips from videos or audio, he edits them to effectively show the proper information during a case.

I found both interactions very helpful as I feel that I am getting to really see in depth all of the different aspects to the legal process and look forward to meeting more people soon!

Thank you for reading my post!

## Week 2: Rotations
Dain Y - **March 6, 2024 10:16 am**

Hello!

This week I had many rotations to meet one-on-one with different employees in the Attorney’s Office. A full list of my meeting topics were:

* Charging
* Victim Notification
* Criminal Paralegal Unit
* Misdemeanors
* Felonies
* Coconino County Attorney’s Office Values
* Attorney’s Office’s Mission

Before I begin with giving a brief overview of what I learned, I thought it would be fitting to talk about the Office’s Values: Justice, Service, Trust, Integrity, Connection and Excellence. Hearing through the descriptions, each one seemed definitely essential for a successful law office, though, I was especially intrigued by the “Connection” aspect of how members of the office often go out and give presentations to the community as I also believe that education of the public is a very important goal and have been doing STEM Outreach for quite some time in high school.

Next, the usual, though not always applicable, steps of the criminal justice process are Initial Appearance, Grand Jury / Preliminary Hearing, Arraignment, Pre-trial Conference, Case Management Conference, Change of Plea, Trial Management Conference, Trial, then Sentencing (with possible Delays).

Going into the different roles in the criminal law division, when talking about Felonies and Misdemeanors, I found that the BASIS Capstone class I did in my senior year, History of Crime, gave me a great foundation for understanding the differences between the two. (To elaborate, Felonies are usually more serious than misdemeanors as they are misdemeanors with some form of aggravated assault, and misdemeanors are smaller offenses in comparison.) In terms of how they are prosecuted, I got to learn that the process of charging is similar for the most part; however, felonies require a longer time to carry out in court.

As for victim notification, I learned that though it may be expected for victims who are reporting a crime to provide information such as their phone number or house address, often times, such information is not available in the Prosecutor by Karpel (PbK) platform I previously mentioned, in which case the role of the victim notification legal assistant is to search up such information in an almost “detective”-like kind of way through search engines. Another thing that surprised me were how many. I was told that the magnitude in cases is not necessarily due to many new individuals committing crimes, but the same individuals committing nearly the same crimes all over again. This being due to the fact that even though an individual has committed a few crimes in the past, they were not incarcerated.

Finally, I was interested to find out that paralegals work closely with victims (almost like victim assistance services), but in a different way. For instance, if a witness needs specific arrangements for travel, lodging, and food in order to attend a court session, the paralegals arrange such services as well among other things that they do.

I have yet to meet with the court translator and focus on the linguistics aspect of my project as they are currently out of town, but I feel that I am greatly benefiting from the rotations and getting the honor and opportunity to meet with a lot of employees at this office.

Thanks for reading this week’s blog post!

## Week 3: Spring Break Post TBD
Dain Y - **March 7, 2024 1:29 pm**

## Week 4: Court Case Observation
Dain Y - **March 20, 2024 11:51 am**

Hello all!

Before Spring Break, I got to observe a trial case that I would like to talk about. Though before I do, some basic plans I having for upcoming days is that I plan to observe more trials at various stages such as hearing the attorney’s opening statements, presentation of evidence, cross-examination, and so forth. Also, I am planning meet with some paralegal assistants in order to learn exactly what kind of work they do, and hopefully learn how to do some of that work myself for future experience as I plan to intern at a law firm as soon as I can during my undergrad years, and possibly work as a Paralegal Assistant, Legal Assistant, or Paralegal Professional  during that time and for a few years afterwards. In terms of my project in regards to translations / linguistics,  I have been in communication with the court translator, who has just returned in office, and plan to meet with her at her earliest convenience.

Back to the court case that I mentioned at the beginning of my blog post, last week I had the valuable opportunity to accompany the paralegal team to the Superior Court, where I observed a pre-hearing court case. While I am unable to disclose specific details about the case, I can share my personal insights that I gained from the experience.

The first aspect that stood out to me was the meticulous preparation and arguments presented by the attorneys on both sides. In this specific case, there appeared to be two defense attorneys (sitting with the defendant) and three prosecuting attorneys, each representing their respective clients with precision and expertise. (The attorney’s office that I am interning at and the paralegal team I went with helped prepare for the prosecuting side.) The attorneys showed an extensive understanding of past U.S. court cases, often citing cases by name to support their legal theories, which made me realize how important it is to learn and retain such information. Furthermore, witnessing the judge’s role in the proceedings provided me with a deeper appreciation for the judiciary’s commitment to fairness. Finally, I got to view a brief discussion on the upcoming jury selection process, which the judge addressed during this pre-hearing case. The judge emphasized the importance of selecting impartial jurors and outlined the criteria for determining which individuals would be eligible to serve.

Overall, my experience observing the court case deepened my understanding of the legal system. Again, while I cannot disclose specific details about the case, the insights I gained continue to increase my excitement for studying in the legal field.

## Week 5: More Court Observations
Dain Y - **March 27, 2024 10:36 am**

Hello everyone! Thank you for visiting my blog!

I will begin by speaking about the trial I observed last week in which I got to fully view both the defense’s witness direct and cross examination. Once again, though I cannot disclose specific details of the case, I would like to share a bit of what I learned.

Firstly, I got to understand that real life trials are a lot different than what you see on TV shows, haha. For instance, in TV shows, sometimes characters that play attorney’s may suddenly present a surprising piece of evidence that it seems the other side did not expect. However, opposing this, in real life both attorneys will have information of all evidence as well as arguments that will be presented during trial per the initial hearing / arraignment. This is where both attorneys will present any evidence or arguments they would like to use during the trial and must get approval from the judge to do so. Therefore, everything in court is very open and transparent, so to speak, for both sides. 

In terms of the examination, it was very interesting to see how structured the whole process was. While the defense attorney was conducting their direct examination, they began with questions that allowed the jury to fully understand the defense’s background. Not only did they ask specific questions about the incident that was being charged on, but even asked for as many details on the day, such as morning / evening routine, food, etc., as the defendant could procure. I later learned that this thorough guidance of how one event leads to another is to prevent an objection for “Lack of Foundation”. “Lack of Foundation” refers to evidence that, to all appearances, can be excused for irrelevance or lack of authentication.

As for upcoming days, in addition to reporting about my experiences in the office, I plan to spend some of my hours offline to read about more studies and articles related to my project’s main inquiry: how linguistic bias may affect the jury’s decision. Due to some personal circumstances, I believe it would be best for me to meet the court translator a bit later, but plan to possibly meet with a couple NAU Professors that specialize in linguistic bias, accents, or linguistics as a whole. So for upcoming days, you can expect a mix of both new information I found from my readings as well as more experiences from my internship!

## Week 6: Getting To Know About Court Interpreters And Translators
Dain Y - **April 3, 2024 3:55 pm**

Hello everyone! Thanks for visiting this week’s blog post!

This week, I was able to meet with the County Court’s main translator, Ms. Judith Costello. Through this meeting, I was able to learn a lot more in depth of the role of a court interpreter which I would like to share with you all.

Before I begin, I would like to highlight that every citizens is given the right to a translator / interpreter if they request. It will not cost them additional charge, or bring bias against their case. In fact, before the a trial in which there is an interpreter, the judge reads to the jury that this will be a case with an interpreter (NOTE: they do not say whether it is defense or prosecution interpreter as interpreters are partial similar to judges.), and that the jury should not let the interpreter bias their perceptions of evidence as in witness testimonies, documents, DNA testing, etc.

This going off topic a bit, but an individual’s right for an interpreter as well as the Court Interpreter Act in Arizona actually came about due to a case called the Hanigan case. (I will only add a very short summary of the case but I highly recommend looking into the exact facts as it was very controversial and interesting.) On August 18, 1976, caucasian ranchers in southern Arizona kidnapped, tortured, and robbed three Mexican migrants who crossed the border at Douglas on their way to Elfrida for farm work.

The case was tried in court up to 3 times during the span of 1976 and 1981, but during one of the trials, an all white trial acquitted the Hanigans (meaning that they decided the verdict for the white ranchers as being not-guilty). Though there were more reasons, one that should be noted was that the translator at that case accidentally mis-translated the word for the object in which one of the Mexican migrants was chained to, chained to a cup v.s. chained to a toilet, influencing the facts of the case.

What followed was several statutes Congress enacted that attempt to remedy these problems including Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Court Interpreters Act of 1978.

And similarly to what people may see in law shows, all citizens have to right to be read their Miranda Rights, and later sign whether or not they were read then whether or not they understood their rights.

Now, firstly, I learned that there is a distinction between translators, who translate written to written information, then interpreters, who translate speech to speech. Next, one must be qualified in order to become a court interpreter specifically. Past qualifications such as being bilingual in a language or having previously worked translation jobs as a freelancer does not qualify someone to be an interpreter. All interpreters in Arizona must take the Arizona Court Interpreter Credentialing Program (ACICP) in order to join the interpreting profession, with their being 5 tiers of Credentials one can receive.

Below I have included the different Tiers and their requirements.

Tier 1 Credential

1. Create a profile in the Arizona Court Interpreter Registry
2. Complete two online classes
3. Pass the English Written Exam and the Oral Proficiency Interview (OPI) in your non-English working language.

Tier 2-4 Credential

1. Possess an ACICP Tier 1 credential
2. Pass the Oral Court Interpreter Exam, which tests all 3 modules of interpreting

Tier A (the 5th) Credential

1. Possess an ACICP Tier 1 credential
2. Pass the OPI at the highest level

Here in the Coconino County Court, the most frequently / commonly needed language is Spanish and American Sign Language (ASL); however, the languages: Navajo, Chinese, Vietnamese, and Arabic are also commonly needed. Additionally, I found that there can be many cases from truck drivers, so such languages like Hindi or Punjabi are commonly requested as well.

When interpreting, there are 3 different types of interpretation:

* Simultaneous
* Consecutive
* Slight Translation

**Simultaneous interpretation** is interpreting done simultaneously (at the same time as another speaker). Because it relies less on memory, it’s used for longer speeches, though interpreters generally swap out with a partner every 30 minutes or so. At the courts here, I learned that translations switch off every 30 to 50 minutes to maintain the quality of their translations. But apart from that, interpreters must pick up all talking that is being done without necessarily a pause unless they request it.

**Consecutive interpretation** is interpreting done consecutively (after a speaker has finished talking). So, if the attorney asks the witness a question, they pause, allow for the interpreter to repeat the sentence to the witness/victim/victim’s family/etc., hear the LEP (Limited English Proficiency) speaker’s response in their native language, then hears the interpreters translation.

**Slight translation** is transforming written message into a spoken message.

An example being if some international companies user agreement (such as Hyundai cars) needed to be read aloud.

Another aspect of interpreting is that the interpreter is free to state to the judge at any moment that they need a repeat of the word, they need a break to search up a word, they need someone in the court room to speak at a slower pace, or in some cases, if the interpreter is not familiar with the terms of a testimony (such as the physics of water tank trucks), they are allowed to pause the case in order to meet with an interpreter/translator familiar with those terms, then learn them through that method.

In some cases, the translating/interpreting office may even recruit an interpreter that is not a court interpreter, but just an individual that is well versed in medical terms for instance, then have them be the interpreter during that specific and short duration of the trial.


As for equipment, here are images of the equipment this specific court uses.

**IMAGE HERE**

\[The headset and transmitter are used by the interpreter, and the earphone and receiver are used by the LEP participant.\]

Below, I have included the link to the 18 Court Interpreter Canons that go into further detail to assure that the interpreting process is partial.

https://www.prd.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/CodeEthics.pdf


Now in terms of bias, my goal for upcoming days is to also meet with the Court Librarian, Ms. Gretchen Hornberger, and hopefully find more statistics for my central topic of linguistic bias in court / to the jury, but some areas in which I have already learned there can be bias or disadvantage for some language groups is the language used itself.

Languages with a more industrialized economy or society may already have many law terms that can be easily translated into english and vice versa (such as the romance languages like French or even asian languages like Korean or Japanese). However, indigenous languages, such as Navajo, does not often have a term for “arraignment” (for example) and would require the translator to have to translate the meaning in one or two sentences just for one word.

Additionally, after hearing the Hanigan case, I learned how important the make-up of the jury is when looking at jury bias. Often times, the jury is made up of a specific demographic of people, an example being that younger individuals that may not often be recruited for jury duty due to needing to study or having children that need to be dropped off/picked up. Therefore, there have been increased efforts to raise voter awareness in certain demographic areas in order to have a more diverse jury composition.

Finally, with the Miranda rights that I mentioned earlier, an issue there is that some LEP individuals may not understand the concept of Miranda rights when they are told of them at the initial arrest. And although I mentioned that they can mark that they did not understand their rights, often culturally, they believe that they cannot say “no” to law enforcement, and mark that they did in contradiction.

Thank you for reading!

## Week 7: Meeting With NAU Applied Linguistics Professor
Dain Y - **April 10, 2024 2:45 pm**

Hello and welcome back to my blog! 🙂

This week I had the opportunity to meet with Dr. Jesse Egbert, an Applied Linguistics Professor at NAU.

Some background on Dr. Egbert is that his focus in linguistics is corpus linguistics. (For those that are unaware of the term, corpus linguistics is the analysis of naturally occurring language or the systematic collection of naturally occurring texts.) And along with teaching courses on corpus linguistics, sociolinguistics, computer programming, and statistical methods, Dr. Egbert is also a co-founder and shareholder of the firm **Corpus Juris Advisors**, and therefore, he ties both worlds of law and linguistics together.

Transitioning back to my meeting with Dr. Egbert, I got to hear about a current project/research Dr. Egbert is doing for something called the ordinary meaning cannon, in which he is doing in collaboration with a Utah legal firm.

The ordinary meaning cannon is best explained by a Professor of Law at Georgetown University Larry Solum’s quote, “Some laws are meant for all citizens and some are meant only for specialists. A text that means one thing in a legal context, might mean something else if it were in a technical manual or a novel.”

What this quote is referring to is that for ambiguous legislatures or legal terms, the judge often reads a statute to avoid ambiguity. However, sometimes, the legal definitions fail to give a good definition or there is no definition entirely, as the law dictionary was not created with the same purpose of a regular dictionary: to thoroughly define a word. There are even cases where there are multiple definitions for a legal term, but sometimes one definition can be beneficial for the defense, and another for prosecution, so it is ultimately the judge’s duty to decide which “definition” to apply to the case.

And it is exactly this issue of wondering what corpus linguistic evidence / “right definition” from the dictionary to use, that had influenced Dr. Egbert’s ongoing solution for this problem.

Using what is called an amicus brief, Dr. Egbert has previously aided courts in order to use linguistic analysis of words as an aiding piece of expertise called corpus linguistic evidence. (An amicus brief is a text that is sufficiently authoritative to be admissible as evidence; though, it is important to note that it is submitted in support of neither party and is meant to be a transparent method.)

Additionally, Dr. Egbert sometimes has preliminary meetings with attorneys in which his team views the case for a few hours, proposes ways that corpus linguistic evidence can be used, and discuss whether or not the attorney’s would like to use the evidence.

It all seems like a seemingly easy addition to add, right?

But then a major question arises: how or when can we apply such amicus briefs or corpus linguistic evidence? As deciding on legal definitions and the ordinary meaning cannon is the responsibility of the judge; however, it may be difficult for them to adopt this method and knowledge as it requires it’s own separate trainings and years of expertise.

And it is this question that is still being looked into by corpus linguists today.



Next was a discussion on the the issue of jury instructions.

When the jury is read jury instructions, the process can take a while, and to some, it may seem like words and information are going through one ear and out the other, even more so if they do not have a written copy to follow along to. (I can attest to this as well having sat through an opening trial, haha.)

So then the question is how much does the jury understand during this process, and are there any terms that they do not fully comprehend?

Though a simple slip up of a few words does not seem like a major issue at a glance, a jury’s understanding of how to apply the law and their instructions can drastically effect how they decide on their outcome for the case.

An example Dr. Egbert used was by taking the term “beyond a reasonable doubt.” For people familiar in the legal field, this may seem like a given term. Although individuals in the legal field may not have an exact percentage of certainty for it, they have a general understanding of what this means or looks like. However, a normal citizen may think that beyond a reasonable doubt has to be 99.99999% certainty.

This led to Dr. Egbert, the Utah Court’s Jury Instruction Revisers, as well as a couple other specialist professors to think of and work to implement solutions such as adding additional language to clarify the meaning, after the legal phrase or term is spoken on the jury instructions.

### Reflection

Although I am not sure I can do anything to research this issue myself such as taking part of ongoing studies, I believe they are all very prevalent issues, and hope to look into more previous court cases or research on these problems in the future.

Thank you!

## Week 8: Final Product – Jury Instruction Sheet
Dain Y - **April 17, 2024 11:42 am**

Hello hello!

This week, I have been doing more self research as well as some brainstorming on my final product.

For my final product, I am hoping to make a jury instruction sheet either cautioning the jury to be aware of any implicit (linguistic) bias or an instruction sheet that elaborates on certain legal words that may potentially cause confusion to those unfamiliar with the word’s definition and have the content of the instructions sheet clarify that.

I do not believe I can actually implement this into a court system, as it would need to have very accurate information and wording. And additionally, I would need to work with a jury instruction revision committee (such as one that Professor Egbert from my last post is collaborating with) and have some kind of degree and/or education in linguistics since I will be using such knowledge to create it. Specifically, crafting clear, effective jury instructions on the topic of linguistic bias, which is a form of implicit bias, requires extensive expertise not only to ensure that the language used is an accurate reflection of linguistic science, but also to ensure that the instruction intervention does use a delivery approach that exacerbate expressions of bias, as I further learned from Professor Egbert. Therefore, since I am not qualified enough in that background, I do not plan to submit the instructions. Instead, the document will be more so a hypothetical instruction sheet that I aim to word similarly to the regular jury instructions one may see/hear in court.

In terms of which kind of instruction sheet I will use (between linguistic bias cautioning vs clarifying legal words), I think I will more likely focus on the first choice, linguistic bias, as if I were to have chosen the former, I believe there would be too much to cover. This is the full document for all criminal case jury instructions for the state of Arizona: https://www.azbar.org/media/g01ktaqc/raji-criminal-6th-ed-2022.pdf. , and if I were to focus on each instruction or word, I believe it would be unending. For instance, once previous case in Virginia that I read in which the victim was charged with the death penalty, there was a debate between how the jury interpreted the difference between the two words, “may” and “shall”.

Therefore, moving forward, I plan to focus more on which instructions I can add to the jury instructions to warn jurors of refraining from letting implicit linguistic bias influence their decision.

Thank you.

## Week 9: Destroying Cases From PbK (Prosecutor By Karpel)
Dain Y - **April 24, 2024 12:16 pm**

Hello everyone and welcome back to my blog post!

This week as well as last week, I got to have some hands on experience with the platform Prosecutor by Karpel, also called PbK here.

Though I have mentioned this platform previously, just to quickly refresh everyone’s memory or explain to those that are new to my blog, it is a the US judicial system’s leading criminal case management software currently and is used in many law firms / offices. The software allows employees and attorneys to input, archive, search for, retrieve, and report on case information, and keeps all case information in a private and secure place.

How I used it this week was by looking at the Charging Unit Work Queue for this office through PbK.

I got to learn more about how cases were inputted by checking to see whether cases complaints were filed in the supreme court. First, I would look at which cases were marked with a note saying, “Check if signed complaint has been received from Justice Court”, then I would look for more information on PbK for the name on the case as well as date of birth. I would then input the information onto a public access case lookup website (https://apps.supremecourt.az.gov/publicaccess/caselookup.aspx?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1) and I would check for the code (CF) which means felony (whereas CM would mean the case is a misdemeanor) and then the year of the case Ex: CF-2024__[additional numbers]__ to look at relevant files. Such relevant files could include the date that a New Minute Entry was received (NEWMINEN), the date that a New Motion / Notice / Pleading was received (NEWMTN), the date of New Law Enforcement Report being received (CRRPTRCD), and so forth and make sure that the dates were relevant. In PbK, all of these acronyms are different events that employees of the attorney’s office can make to keep an organized and detail record of the status of the case, when letters for misdemeanors or felonies are prepared, when the case is charged and much more.

And starting last week continuing onto this week I got to work on an project for clearing files in the office by destroying cases from PbK.

Essentially, what I got trained to do was first sort out the hard copy files labeled misdemeanors and felonies apart. Then, I would take the misdemeanor files and search it in PbK by inputing the year on the file as well as a 4 digit file number. Once I found the file on the PbK database, I would make sure that the Status = Closed and Stage = Closed, as well as making sure that the CMSREV Review File for Destruction date was past (so nothing that had a future date past April 2024). An example would look like: 06-23-2021 CMSREV Review Files for Destruction 05-18-2019. Then, I would click “Add Event” then choose CMSDES (which simply stands for destroying the case), click “Build Event” then “Add Event”. After that, the stage on PbK will appear as Destroyed instead of closed. Once finishing the online portion, I would put the hard copy file in the shredder after removing any media (such as CDs or hard drives) and placed it in a separate bin.

By looking at all these misdemeanor files, I had the opportunity to be exposed to what examples of misdemeanors in Flagstaff may look like, which I will include the names below exactly as they were printed on the files:

DISORDERLY CONDUCT

DRIVING ON A SUSPENDED LICENSE EXCEED LIMIT BY 20/45 MPH

DRIVING ON A SUSPENDED LICENSE MANDATORY INSURANCE REGISTRATION SUSPENSION

EXCEEDING 85 MPH

TAKE ELK WITHOUT VALID LICENSE. TAKE ELK WITHOUT VALID TAG

Thank you for reading my post!

## Week 10: Last Week At The Attorney’s Office And Presentation Prep
Dain Y - **May 1, 2024 8:54 pm**

Hello!

This will be my last blogpost before I present my senior project at school. I can’t believe time flew by so quickly! After this, I will upload my Conclusion post summarizing my experience interning at the Coconino County’s Attorney’s Office as well as my experience during my presentation.

### Challenges:

As I have been preparing for my upcoming presentation, the absence of public viewing materials / images in my powerpoint poses as a unique challenge. As I have mentioned before, since most of the work and materials I saw were confidential, I was not able to take pictures to share with everyone unfortunately. However, I’m determined to hopefully create a compelling narrative that will help everyone take a deeper dive with me into my experience interning despite this issue!

### The Evolution of the Jury Sheet / My Final Product:

A milestone in my internship journey has been that I have finally finished my final product- the revision of the jury instruction sheet!

As I was reading through the jury instruction sheet for preliminary criminal trial rules, I found that there were “long versions” and “short versions” of each guideline, where the long version copied the shorter versions exact vocabulary, but elaborated on certain definitions or words. I thought this was a great solution for clearer legal guidelines, and decided to specifically refine the Preliminary Criminal 21.1 guideline to ensure fairness and understanding by creating a longer version of it myself. This expanded version underscores the importance of linguistic fairness and impartiality in our legal system, and I will insert the example below:

### *Short / Original Version:*

#### Preliminary Criminal 21.1 (Short Version) − Interpreter for the Defendant 

Every person is entitled to a fair trial regardless of the language a person speaks and regardless of how well a person may, or may not, use the English language. Many citizens and noncitizens have a primary language other than English. Our Constitution protects all people within our state regardless of their nationality or their proficiency with the English language. Bias against or for a person who has little or no proficiency in English, or because the speaker does not use English, is not allowed. The fact that the defendant requires an interpreter must not influence you, in your deliberations, in any way.

### *Long / My Version:*

#### Preliminary Criminal 21.1 (Long Version) − Interpreter for the Defendant 

In our judicial system, it is imperative to uphold the fundamental principle of fair treatment for all individuals, irrespective of their linguistic background or proficiency in the English language. Every person, whether a citizen or noncitizen, is entitled to a fair trial, and this includes access to interpretation services when necessary. 

The use of an interpreter by a defendant or any other party involved in legal proceedings should not be viewed as a reflection of their credibility or the validity of their claims. It is essential to recognize that language barriers and bias exist and can impede effective communication, particularly in legal contexts where precise understanding is paramount.

As jurors, it is incumbent upon you to approach the testimony of witnesses, regardless of their language proficiency or use of an interpreter, with impartiality and objectivity. The presence of an interpreter should not influence your assessment of the evidence presented or the credibility of the individuals involved.

Throughout this trial, it is essential to guard against any bias or prejudice that may arise due to factors such as Limited English Proficiency (LEP) when the defendant or witness chooses to speak English but uses an accent. Accents are natural variations in speech that do not diminish the reliability or truthfulness of a statement. Any inclination to discredit the testimony of a witness based solely on their accent must be avoided, as it undermines the integrity of the judicial process. Your duty as jurors is to weigh the evidence presented impartially and render a verdict based solely on the facts and the law. Any assumptions or biases related to language proficiency or accent must be set aside in the pursuit of justice.



Until we meet again for the final blog!

Thanks for reading (:
