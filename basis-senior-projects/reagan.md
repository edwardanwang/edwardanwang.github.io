# Homelessness: A Political Divide

**Internal Advisor:** Andrew Robarge
**External Advisor:** Coral Evans
**Internship Location:** Mayor's Community Policy Trust

### Abstract

No matter where you go there will always be homeless individuals. The presence of these individuals tends to impact tourism and create what looks like an unsafe environment. Due to this, many cities are trying to solve homelessness and each city has a different way of dealing with the unhoused population. These ideas being passed by cities can be categorized into either punitive, which is more punishment based, or non-punitive, which is less punishing. By looking into the trends of each method we can compare it to the cities using the same versus the opposing method we can assume which way is more successful to get and keep the homeless population off of the streets. Examining both the short and long term impacts allows us to look more closely at other factors, such as rehabilitation, employment, and a criminal record. This allows us to gain a new understanding about what it really means to decrease homelessness and the varying success rates of previous attempts.

## Introduction To “Homelessness: A Divide”
Reagan M - **February 21, 2024 10:05 am**

My name is Reagan, thank you, guys, for reading my introductory post. I’m hoping that this post will give you a better understanding of why I am doing this project and the importance of it to me. All of my life, my parents have been involved with local politics and always stressed the importance of voting. Part of that was driving by any store and if there was someone outside my parents would lecture about how they were faking it, or how it was their fault. I was getting older and noticed the issue of homelessness kept getting pushed to the side and when I started working, I noticed the snide comments and assumptions. Notably, as I got older I would notice the police: When my boss called them, how they dealt with the homeless population vs other people, how they tended to park their cars closer to the congregation of homeless people. But one question still arose: What if they weren’t faking it? Or how would you know if they were faking it? This led me to wonder how we solve homelessness. That is not going to happen with this project, but taking steps to get and keep the unhoused off of the streets can help identify what works and how to implement the policies.  My project is textually analyzing different policies addressing and explaining the issue of homelessness and how the non-punitive, less punishing, methods can better accomplish the long-term goal of reducing homelessness. This project aims to show that while punishing people for being homeless works, it is not sustainable in the long run and that if we want a difference to be made we have to assist in a non-punitive manner.

## Starting On The Review Of Japans Policies!
Reagan M - **February 28, 2024 9:45 am**

This week I started to focus on Japan and its policies. Japan is a country with one of the lowest homeless rates. The definition of homelessness in Japan is someone who conducts their daily lives in a public space, including sleeping. There is a trend called “visible homelessness” that has been on the rise. Visible homelessness is where someone lives their daily life in public spaces but still has a roof over their head. So if you sleep in a shelter you do not fall under the definition of homelessness, but it will look like visible homelessness. Drugs, other than alcohol, in Japan, are strictly illegal and only accessible through gangsters, because of this the rate of drug addicts in Japan is lower than in the United States. Japan tends to take a more humanitarian view in their government. When a person is dealing with mental illness there is more space in a psychiatric ward for them, and more beds per 100,000 people, in Japan, sparing them from the streets. In Japan, the shelters have more open space allowing for easy housing. 

From 2007 to 2019 Japan has had a steady decrease in homelessness, partially credited to the formation of the Homeless Independence Support Act (HISA). HISAs main goal is to move people off the street, decreasing visible homelessness, and into emergency shelters during the winter. HISA started in 1995 when the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Office of Policy Planning announced Directions in Response to New Urban Problems: Concerning Living on the Streets (DRNUP). In 1996 DRNUP started construction of moving walkways, but when homeless people tried to hinder this development, it led to civil unrest and police involvement. The DRNUP cleared away cardboard shelters in the underground passages. Even though there are moving walkways, hindering how the homeless live, and destruction of shelters, I am tempted to say that these policies are non-punitive because the only time there was police involvement was when there was civil unrest. Because the rate of homelessness is decreasing it is seen as effective.

## Japan Continued!
Reagan M - **March 6, 2024 9:46 am**

Reading up on Japan’s views on homelessness was very interesting. From what I have read there also seems to be a cultural influence. Begging in Japan is illegal and this greatly impacts the homeless, and with these prejudices, of being so desperate you have to break the law, many people reject the help offered because they consider it offensive. In the United States, for comparison, it is not uncommon to see people outside of a grocery store or on a highway ramp begging with signs mentioning military service or a dog to gain sympathy. 

In Japan, in 2017 the Homeless Self-Support Act (HSSA) was approved for a ten-year extension. HSSA provides support when looking for a job, by providing training courses. I like HSSA because there are incentives for the business to hire these people through training courses. While at face value this seems similar to the United States the idea of training someone for a job has not been an idea the States have utilized. The closest thing that I have found in my reading has been limiting police involvement so that a homeless person can apply for jobs without having their resume hindered by an arrest. Looking at that incentive and the age that HSSA affects, people in their 50’s, it makes sense that a business would want to hire someone who is 52 years old, with training, and not a 20-year-old with no training. I feel the business looks at the maturity difference between the two ages and the training saves the company time and money. 

The training is a non-punitive practice, in fact, the opposite, because it prepares the person for the long run. The training allows a person to gain a job, gain more experience, and start the process of rising through the ranks of a field of work. A steady income allows the person to start saving up for housing and allows them a more permanent opportunity to stay off of the streets. With the 10-year extension, I am excited to see if it will continue to work.

## Review Of Japan
Reagan M - **March 20, 2024 12:04 pm**

Going into the research of Japanese policies I expected a few things to be different, number one, I expected them to use the same definition of homelessness, and number two, I expected more police involvement. When looking at the United States, I would first want to change the definition of homelessness. If we change it to something similar to Japan’s where only people without shelter are considered homeless, the percentage of our population that is homeless goes down. One problem I see occurring would be other countries and nations following in our footsteps and then we would have two measures of homelessness: actual and visual. The two mesures of homelessness would put us back at square one. Right now the United States does have a very good definition of homelessness for our situation.

With the police involvement Japan had very limited involvement, which I really support, and the involvement was for the mini revolt about sidewalk reconstruction. In the United States police can be involved for simple things like sleeping on a bench. 

One thing that really surprised me is how much impact the culture has in Japan. The refusal to accept help because begging is illegal and frowned upon is one notable thing that I believe we need to slowly incorporate into the United States. I do not think it is possible right now without including more police involvment. One possible thing that we can do to start begging being seen as disrespectful is to teach our kids. We should instal that pride in our kids, that relying on other people, for something as major as housing, is not the right way to go about it, similar to Japans ideas.

Japan is able to keep a incredibly low homeless rates because they not only have a different definition but they also have more space for people to stay during the night. There is no need to cause shame by having police involvement because the culture already stresses the shame so the police don’t have too.

## Nigeria - It Was A Bust.
Reagan M - **March 27, 2024 7:16 pm**

With Japan wrapped up, I want to focus on Nigeria’s high homeless population (~17% of its total population). A few things I want to consider are that Nigeria is not as developed as the United States or Japan, and their definition of homelessness.

In Nigeria, one of the main issues is the eviction process. The government rarely gives any warning to the inhabitants and uses violence to force the residents out. About 70% of the population already lives either at or below the poverty line. Another thing is the terrorist attacks in 2009 that still have millions displaced and a flood in 2018 that also spread cholera. What makes Nigeria a little different is most of the focus is on the homeless kids, not really the middle-aged people like Japan. Nigeria has so much more going on in terms of women’s rights and maternal health. Nigeria’s government has a history of corruption and electing people who embezzle funds.  

Nigeria also has an inflation problem, their money is inflation at a massive rate, so the cost of living is rising, so more people are going to be living at or below the poverty line

The reason Nigeria is not doing a whole lot in terms of homelessness is because they can’t. With the hopeful rebuild of the government, the first thing that needs to be upheld is making sure more of the population does not become homeless. The poor eviction strategies and the major percentage of the population living in poverty are breeding grounds for an even higher homeless rate. If the government focuses on the poverty line and tries to fix that first they can re-evaluate and see how they can help the women and children living in homelessness. Many charities and organizations focus on the children and trying to get them into school to help with their future. I would say Nigeria is not punitive or non-punitive because they are not doing anything to combat homelessness.

## India - Non-Punitive And Not Working.
Reagan M - **April 3, 2024 10:00 am**

With Nigeria being a bust, I still want to focus on a place with a high homeless rate and policies in place, India. In India, there is expensive housing, wealth inequality, and discrimination. In this context if housing costs more than 30% of your income it is unaffordable. The unaffordable housing is similar in the United States where the average person’s housing arrangements cost ~50% of their pay.

What landlords can do to change this is to charge people what they can afford and not the most amount, to maximize profits. However, this is not viable because the main point of being a landlord is to maximize profit. One thing that I keep hearing is just pay your employees more. But raising the minimum wage causes the cost of living to go up as well. Eventually, if we reach a crisis we will have to lower the prices but right now they would still rise. However, to evict a tenant landlords must provide a notice with the reason for eviction and a reasonable timeframe for the tenant to leave. Unlike Nigeria where eviction can be spontaneous and at any time for any reason.

Another option is to make more low-income housing. What is difficult about this for both the states and India is the supply and demand chain. With the large populations, there is not enough supply to keep up with the demand so it’s more expensive. 

In India, there is also sexism where even if women make enough money to support themselves it is difficult for them to convince landlords that they will pay rent on time. 

Cities in India also face wealth inequality. The top 1% runs about ~40% of the country and is getting richer quickly while the lower classes struggle to get minimum wage. 

From my understanding, India is a densely populated country, and the wealth inequality makes it very hard for people to break out of poverty. The healthcare system is failing because the hospitals and other care centers and ill-equipped and underfunded. Despite this, it seems that India is still using non-punitive measures through non-government organizations (NGOs) providing temporary shelters and services. The government of India is also using PMAY schemes which are facilitating access to low-income and affordable housing. The PMAY scheme allowed for the construction of 20 million houses at an affordable price. However, despite these efforts, the percentage of the population of India that is homeless has been rising, along with the percentage of the population that is mentally ill and the population that suffers from addiction.

## India Summary And Hungary
Reagan M - **April 10, 2024 9:06 am**

Senior project blogs are almost done and so far I have only been talking about non-punitive measures and policies. For the sake of time, my summary of India will be condensed. At the same time, non-punitive India’s measures do not work. One reason is the major wealth gap, the cost of living in India is based on an economically weak housing situation. Many of the housing does not have air conditioning and in the summer the heat makes it hard to sleep. While there are over 100 shelters in Delhi the beds in all the shelters, permanent and temporary, are about 92% of the estimated homeless population. India is doing the right thing but the conditions laid out by government schemes make it so that actual homeless people do not qualify for the programs, due to the lack of identification documents. They have the right idea, but the wrong execution.

Switching over to Hungary where Budapest has more homeless people than almost any other Eastern European capital. What Hungary did to combat this is something similar to many ideas in the American policies, Hungary made habitual residence in a public space forbidden. What this means is homeless people sitting or lying somewhere among their spread-out belongings constitute a lifestyle in a public space. If they do not follow police orders to leave the site and head to a shelter, they can automatically be called to do community work. If they refuse, they can be detained. They can also be taken into custody if they ignore police requests to leave that space three times over a three month period. I would consider this punitive because it jumps straight to police intervention and there is no rehabilitation. The police are allowed to destroy or confiscate any personal items, at any time.

Hungary does have emergency and temporary shelters where each room has a maximum of 20 beds but only 14 hours of the day are free. There are also rehabilitation centers but there are requirements, they must be able to rehabilitate themselves and the services aim to improve relationships and become a reliable employee. The soup kitchens offer shelter to the older homeless population, however the food they serve is only about 12% of the daily value needed.

All in all Hungary is punitive, immediately using police intervention, and the shelters and hostels charge a fee to use. This is not working because the homeless population in Hungary is still rising.

## Can Homeless Shelters Be Punitive?
Reagan M - **April 17, 2024 9:02 am**

Punitive and non-punitive policies have had some similarities which I was not expecting. One of the major questions that I have been thinking of is how can alternate housing and homeless shelters be punitive. 

The first thing I want to do is change my stance on India’s policies, I think they are punitive. Many of the shelters are inaccessible to the homeless with physical disabilities, as well as being camouflaged. The shelters also require a fee to spend the night, similar to Hungary. In some cases the shelters do not allow people to bring in their personal belongings, discouraging people from going there. I believe the lack of incentives to keep the shelters clean and safe also contributes to the lack of people who stay there. The risk of the temporary shelters being demolished and the occupants having to move again is also a factor. 

Many of the homeless population do not have access to physical identification or the money needed to stay the night in these shelters and because of the lack of ID and money many of the homeless population can’t get the medical help they need. 

Back on what makes shelters punitive, I believe it comes down to the expectations, which are their expectations of having physical identification, money, and belongings. In both India and Hungary, you need money and in some cases physical Identification. In Flagstaff, Arizona there is a Motel 6 that Flagstaff Shelter Services (FSS) acquired and they are changing it into The Lantern, they have support in the form of meals, medical help, and help finding housing. In order to have access to this you have to have a lease–style agreement that sets standards for behavior, some of the rules are no guests or partying. The purpose of The Lantern is to help find housing opportunities and gain support to get housing, not to be a permanent fixture.

This really highlights the expectations between punitive and non-punitive to me. In India and Hungary the expectation is you almost need to prove that you deserve to spend the night with no help with food or medical, but with The Lantern it is there to help people find housing and provides the materials to make sure people can get steady, permanent housing.

## Everything Is Better Is Texas.
Reagan M - **April 24, 2024 9:52 am**

Now with a few examples of punitive and non-punitive punishment, we can start to gather a basic idea of what works and what doesn’t. There is a new idea that is going around notably in Houston Texas, housing first, help second. This idea started in 2011 to reduce and prevent homelessness over 4 years, but in 2024 the plan is still in action and the Houston’s homeless population has dropped about 60%. One of the notable changes is organizations and non-profits are working and building off of each other. One group helps get belongings, one group gets the housing, and so on. The main point is to provide housing first then rehab and finding jobs and other help second.

Despite so many people finding housing, one thing that is not guaranteed is stability. The program, Housing First Initiative (HFI), does not protect those helped by the HFI from evictions. Stephan Lockhart who was a veteran in the HFI program was evicted. The eviction was partly due to lost paperwork and not knowing who graduated from the program. While the rent is cheap and there are safeguards in place to make sure that even if the rent is late there are supports in place. 

One more quick note is that housing is much cheaper in Texas so building and maintaining houses is more attainable than in other places.  

I love this idea. I also find it important to know that these policies and ideas are new, in execution. There are a lot of things that need to be worked out, such as where is the money going to come from, and how are we going to limit the evictions. But above all, it is working, it is lowering Houston’s homeless population and helping people gain sobriety and jobs. Implementing these policies and ideas would help in other places like Phoenix and places like Los Angeles have traveled to Houston to look at the HFI.

## Relocation- Busses.
Reagan M - **May 1, 2024 9:27 am**

This sounds kind of sick, or twisted, but today I’m covering a topic I have been looking forward to, the process of putting homeless people on busses and moving them to different states. Relocation programs offer homeless people free, one-way, bus tickets. 

This problem is more severe in the west, California, Oregon, and Washington. Many homeless people view this as a fresh start and the thing they need to save money and just live. In some cases, the bus tickets move the person back to some family or friends where they can sleep and have a roof over their head. 

This seems like a great solution, however in Key West, they tell the person that the ban is for 6 months, and it turns out the ban is forever. The word ban might seem a little extreme but what the bus ticket is, is a promise to not come back for an allotted amount of time. If they do return they cannot have access to any services for the homeless. One common misconception is that the homeless are going to go be homeless elsewhere when in fact it is agreed upon that that is just not okay. What happens is when the person hears about the ticket they have to sign a contract. The contract states that the homeless person has someone they are going to see where they can live with that person, the case worker then gives that person a call confirming that the homeless person has a place to stay, before the ticket is distributed.

After reading this you might be wondering why I think this is punitive. It’s because if someone goes from Los Angeles, California to Billings, Montana, and then back to Los Angeles they would not have access to any programs or support for homeless people.
