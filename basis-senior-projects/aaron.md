### Abstract

In my project, I plan to train for and complete an Ironman triathlon and while doing so, discover how an ironman will affect the mental and physical state of an athlete. As well as uncover what it takes to complete an Ironman triathlon. I also plan to learn what challenges and fears an athlete faces when training for one. An Ironman is one of the hardest endurance races ever and completing one gives insight into who you are and what you are able to accomplish. During this project I will be training for the Ironman in Flagstaff, which is an optimal place because of its high elevation. To learn about an Ironman triathlon, I will document the training that goes into it and the outcome of racing in Ironman Texas. Through this project I hope to learn about the challenges an Ironman presents and how to accomplish goals that at first may seem impossible.

## Becoming Ironman – Week 1 – 2/21/24

Project Title: Becoming Ironman

My name is Aaron B and for the last year I have been obsessed with triathlons. My first experience with triathlons was when I was 9 years old. I completed a very short triathlon that consisted of a 100 meter swim, a 5 mile bike ride, and a half mile run. That triathlon, that I completed so long ago, was my only triathlon that I had ever done. That is before I completed the Mountain Man 70.3 triathlon in August of 2023. That triathlon consisted of a 1.2 mile swim, a 56 mile bike ride, and a 13.1 mile run.

What got me back into the world of triathlons you might ask? Well in August of 2022 I volunteered at that same triathlon with my cross-country team. While at the race we helped the triathletes at the finish line. As they crossed across the finish line, I could not help but be amazed of the distance that the athletes did and the speed at which they were able to do it in. This reignited the flame that was inside of me way back when I did my very first triathlon and I wanted to do more.

Now after completing my first endurance triathlon, I look to an even bigger challenge. Ironman Texas. Double the distance, double the training, and double the pain.

The focus of this project is to complete this daunting task. To do this, hours upon hours must be spent in the pool, on the bike, and on the roads and trails of Flagstaff. To succeed in such a demanding and rigorous training plan, determination is key. Along the way I will document the process and try and learn how my mental and physical state will change throughout the process of training for an Ironman triathlon, and the optimal way to train for an endurance event. I hope to not only learn about what it takes to complete an Ironman but also what I am capable of going forward into college and life.

## Becoming Ironman – Week 2 – 2/28/24
Aaron B - **February 27, 2024 12:00 pm**

In just a few moments everything can be lost. I was at track and field practice going over hurdles. I was on a mission to improve my hurdling form to make it to State in that event this year. However, as I was going over the hurdle, I caught my foot and fell right on my elbow. I rolled out of it and got right back up, I felt pain in both my elbow and my hands. I sat there for a few minutes before heading to my car and frantically driving home. I knew something was wrong from the rapid swelling in my elbow. I was hyperventilating and was unable to think about anything other than not being able to train for and complete Ironman Texas. My mom drove me to the hospital as soon as I got home and for the next 3 hours we took x-rays, waited, and was delivered the heartbreaking news that I had broken my radial head, which is right on the elbow. I could not stop crying for the next hour. Everything I had worked for, months of training and preparing for the race disappeared in an instant. I felt like I had lost one of the most important things in my life right now.

The next few days were more than difficult. On a day that should have been a 4 hour bike ride I was instead sitting on the couch and struggling to complete simple tasks. The only comfort I had was the frequent visits from my girlfriend as well as the support and help from my parents.

Monday came and I had an appointment with an orthopedic doctor. He took off the splint, took more x-rays, and told me what is going to happen. Going into the appointment my parents and I were expecting either a cast or surgery. However, I was given the best news I have heard in awhile. The solution was not a cast or surgery but instead movement. The Ironman, which just a few days prior seemed out of the question, is now a much more promising “maybe”.

I am now working on my arm mobility, trying to get my elbow unlocked from its current bent position. I also plan to get back on the spin bike today as well as throughout the week to keep my legs from loosing their muscle. My plan is still to train for and complete Ironman Texas. A broken bone is just a bump in the road. Just one more challenge to add onto one of the toughest single day races in the world.

In just a few moments everything can be lost. However, taking it one day at a time can help you realize that there is still a road ahead, even if it seems that everything that you have worked for is gone.

## Becoming Ironman – Week 3 – 3/6/2024
Aaron B - **March 5, 2024 12:04 pm**

While my training has been severely stunted from the fracture in my arm, I have already completed 10 weeks of my training plan. During this time, I have learned a lot about what it takes to complete an Ironman triathlon. There were two main difficulties that I faced throughout my training so far. One being diet and the other being injury.

Doing over 14 hours of training a week makes it hard to get the nutrition that you need to be able to sustain the large amount of exercise. I learned quickly that I needed to work on eating food during my exercises if I want to make it through the Ironman. The other difficulty I had was injury. On the 18th day of my training plan I went on a 50 min run on singletrack and although I did not feel any pain during the run, later that night my knee swelled up and did not heal for a week. I suspect that the injury either came from doing too much training too fast or from hyperextending my knee during the run. This injury, although not having nearly as significant an impact on my training as my broken arm, did teach me that rest and not training is sometimes the most beneficial thing to do.

This last week I have made sure to rest. However, I have also made sure to not stay sedentary. I have done a bike ride on the spin bike which felt good on the legs but not so much on the arm. I have also been on a two mile walk each day. In an effort to help my arm, I have been attempting to straighten and bend it to get mobility back in the joint. Although my arm can still not fully extend, the improvement in the last week has been great. Later this week I plan to go on a run. Hopefully my arm will feel good during it.

I am still waiting to see if I need to get surgery for my fracture. I have to give it another two weeks before I’ll know if surgery is the correct option, until then, I’m focusing on moving my arm, slowly working back into my training, researching more about Ironman, and overcoming this road bump in my journey of becoming an Ironman.

## Becoming Ironman – Week 4 – 3/13/2024
Aaron B - **March 12, 2024 10:50 am**

This past week I have been reminded how fast you can loose your fitness. One reminder being the size of my arm, which from the lack of movement, has decreased significantly. I got another reminder on a short five mile hike which had some steep sections, my legs were much more tired than they would have been just two weeks before. This realization of how fast you can loose your fitness is a little bit disheartening since I have spent months training and much of that progress is being lost.

Knowing how fast you can lose your fitness has led to me thinking a lot about aging and how when we get older we stop exercising, lose our fitness, and blame it on our old age. So, I have looked a lot into fitness and exercise as we grow older.

One example that I would like to bring up is, Hiromu Inada. Inada is the oldest person ever to complete an Ironman at the Ironman World Championships in Kona, Hawaii. He completed an Ironman at 87 years old, and he only started doing triathlons at age 70. Even now he is still active, he completed and Olympic distance triathlon, about one forth of an Ironman distance, when he was 90. Weekly he completes 250 miles of biking, 19 miles of running, and swims just under 10 miles. And when he was planning on attempting and Ironman again at age 90 he said “It’s not that I’m doing it because I’m 90. I just happen to be turning 90, and it’s a goal that looks achievable.”

We only loose our ability to do the things we love because we stop doing them. Exercise is just as important or even more important as we grow older. Inada shows that we can do extraordinary things even as we age. While others at that age are unable to walk, he is able to complete an Ironman. It is because he has never stopped exercising.

Just two and a half weeks after I have broken my arm I have lost muscle and have felt weaker than I had. This is only after two weeks, I can only imagine what impact not exercising for years can have. One thing that I hope people get out of my project is to not put limits on themselves and go chase their dreams no matter who or how old you are or what obstacles come your way.

## Becoming Ironman – Week 5 – 3/20/2024
Aaron B - **March 20, 2024 9:49 am**

This week brings good news. On Monday I had a follow up appointment for my elbow where more x-rays were taken of the fracture. The doctor said that the bone is now completely stable and that I have great mobility in my elbow for a little over three weeks from breaking it. Running, biking, and swimming are all good as long as I don’t fall. I have also been told by the doctor that my fracture will be fully healed by the race and I will be able to compete in Ironman Texas.

With this good news I hope to start getting back to my long runs and bike rides as well as adding back in swims. Yesterday was my first time back in the pool, and although the swim was painful with my elbow hurting with every other stroke, I was still able to swim father than I thought I was going to be able to.

One aspect of training that I feel is highly beneficial is weight training. Not only does it improve strength but it can also help with muscle endurance. This is one aspect of training that I will unfortunately miss out on. Although I am able to swim, bike, and run I am still unable to lift weights or put more than ten pounds of weight on my arm. I wonder how the lack of weight training will have on my performance during the Ironman.

The fracture in my arm has presented itself to be a challenge from both the impact that it has had on my training in the last few weeks as well as the impact it continues to have. I believe though that with both the ten weeks of training that I completed before the fracture as well as the five weeks of training that I still have will be enough to complete Ironman Texas.

## Becoming Ironman – Week 6 – 3/27/2024
Aaron B - **March 26, 2024 9:02 pm**

Fear. It is something I am feeling more and more as I get closer to Ironman Texas. I fear going to Texas and being exhausted after doing the swim. I fear going to Texas and having to walk the marathon. I fear going to Texas and not being able to cross the finish line. I fear not being able to complete what I set out to do. I wonder if these fears are because of my broken arm or if I would have had these fears either way. I believe I would have had these fears regardless, however, the broken arm has certainly played a role.

Although I fear what will come in the next few weeks, I believe I can gain a lot from this experience.

One thing I wanted to learn going into this project was if my mental strength would change. So far, I believe it has not. I feel just as determined as I did when I began this project. However, one thing that I think will improve from completing the Ironman is becoming more confident in trying things that at first seem undoable. If I can complete an Ironman, overcoming a broken arm only nine weeks before the race, I believe I will become stronger in this way. It does not matter if we fear doing something as long as we don’t let that fear stop us from doing the things we want to do. Going into college, this will be a valuable tool, things such as starting a business might seem less daunting after completing an Ironman. If I was able to complete one thing that seemed impossible just two years before, why can I not complete another.

Fear is something we all experience, something I am experiencing now and something I will experience many times again. However, it seems that the things we fear are the things that are the most worth doing, rewarding, and empowering.

## Becoming Ironman – Week 7 – 4/3/2024
Aaron B - **April 2, 2024 10:01 pm**

It is crazy how much goes into preparing for an Ironman beyond just the training. Not only do you have to get the equipment together for one event but three. Swimming, biking, and running all require their own specific gear. The base of all the sports is the tri suit. Swimming requires a wetsuit, goggles, and a swimming cap. The wet suit is only allowed if the water temperature is below 76.1 degrees Fahrenheit. The wetsuit is helpful since it provides extra bouncy in the water making swimming more efficient.

For the bike ride you need a bike, helmet, biking shoes, water bottles/backpack, and gels for nutrition. One thing I have been considering getting for the bike ride is tubeless carbon fiber  rims. A thing that went wrong during my Half Ironman triathlon is a flat tire from a fallen piece of metal from the bike in front of me. Although a tubeless tire will not make it impossible to get a flat tire, it will make it much easier to fix if it does deflate. In addition to having it be tubeless it would be carbon fiber which is something that could make a significant difference for such a long race.

Finally for the run you need your final set of equipment. Which only requires you to change into some running shoes, grab some more nutrition, and you are ready.

Another aspect that needs to be considered is getting all the equipment to Texas. We are going to fly to Houston and will need to get the bike there on the plane, which can be easily transported in a bike box after being broken down, as well as multiple pairs of shoes, my wetsuit, and all the other gear and food I will need to complete the race. Although it is a lot to keep track of it should be much less difficult than actually completing the Ironman.

## Becoming Ironman – Week 8 – 4/10/2024
Aaron B - **April 9, 2024 9:29 pm**

Today I had my last appointment for my arm. After taking three more x-rays the doctor said all looks good and it has healed perfectly. I am less than three weeks out from Ironman Texas, only two until I get on a plane to fly there. So, this marks the last two weeks left of training before tapering and then racing on April 27th.

It is exciting yet scary being this close to the Ironman. Even though I have lost a lot of training because of the broken arm I am remembering that I have done the best I could given my circumstances.

In the next three weeks I will be focusing on getting all the things together that I talked about in the previous blog post. The most important of which being nutrition. During an Ironman triathletes can burn up to 10,000 calories over the course of the race. So, it is extremely important to have hourly fluid, food, and electrolyte targets.

From my research I have found that during the bike you should be consuming around 350 calories and hour and then 200 calories an hour during the run to avoid complete exhaustion resulting in not finishing the race. In addition to just calories you have to make sure you are getting the right amount of salt. It is important to have salt in both your water and your foods during the race. This is especially true at Ironman Texas where I will not only be racing in the heat but also in the humidity.

The nutrition before the Ironman and even the whole week prior can also have a huge effect on the outcome of your race. Seven to Ten days before to the race a high carb diet is essential and three to four days before extra salt on foods is recommended.

The last crucial element to nutrition during an Ironman is a high carb breakfast so you have energy to burn every hour of the race.

An Ironman is a test of endurance both physically and mentally but no matter how much you train, if you don’t have the proper nutrition you will not be able to finish such a long and demanding race.

## Becoming Ironman – Week 9 – 4/17/2024
Aaron B - **April 16, 2024 8:41 pm**

One week from today I will be on a plane to Huston Texas. This last week I have finally felt like I have gotten back into my training and have fully recovered from the broken arm. I went on a four hour ride and completed a swim just short of the full Ironman distance. Unfortunately, this really good training will only continue for a few more days. Then the full week before the Ironman I will taper. This means that I will only do a fraction of the training I have been doing so I have fresh muscles and lots of energy for race day.

In my last bits of training before the race one of my main goals is to practice scouting. This is essential to navigate in the open water and swim an efficient route without having to correct the direction I am going every few strokes. This is a skill that I lacked during my half Ironman distance triathlon which led me to swim a little bit further than I had to. I don’t think I will have as much trouble with this at Ironman Texas since there will so many people around me the entire time, it should be easy to see where to go.

This past week I have also been reading up on the course, more importantly, the aid stations. There will be an aid station every fifteen miles on the bike course and every one mile on the run course. This should provide plenty of fuel and hydration throughout the course. One thing I found out when researching the course is that there is a supply bag that you can drop off at the halfway point in both the bike and run. You can leave supplies such as extra food or socks to pick up during the race.

Only eleven days left until the Ironman. It is almost here!

## Becoming Ironman – Week 10 – 4/24/2024
Aaron B - **April 23, 2024 7:17 pm**

It is race week! I am currently in Houston Texas getting ready in the last days leading up to Ironman Texas. I have got all of my stuff, including the bike, to Texas successfully, now the only thing to do is wait a few more days and than race in Ironman Texas.

I have been paying close attention to the weather in The Woodlands area these last few days and it is looking like it will be cloudy and unfortunately windy. Since the bike course is an out and back I will have to fight the wind for at least half the duration of the bike ride. On the positive side, the wind will keep me cool in the 88 degree weather on Saturday. Another positive note about the weather is that it does not look like it will rain like, so I will be able to race on dry pavement and have better visibility during the swim.

The final part of my preparation for the race is my strategy. My original goal was to complete the Ironman in 12.5 hours, however, because of the impact of the broken arm on my training, I need to reevaluate this goal. Instead of going for a certain time, I need to just try my best and enjoy the experience no matter what the result is out on the course. My strategy during the race is to always go easier than I feel I need to. I need to make sure that I don’t run out of energy early on in the race. So, I will take my time during the swim, try and go easy on the bike, which is looking difficult since I will have to battle the wind, and during the run I will run for 15 minutes and walk for 5 until I finish the race.

Wish me luck on Saturday.

## Becoming Ironman – Week 11 – 5/1/2024
Aaron B - **April 30, 2024 10:47 pm**

I am an Ironman! It has been quite the journey these past 20 weeks. There have been so many ups and downs, but I have made it.

There were over 2700 athletes competing in the race. The process that was required to run the event smoothly was amazing. It all started on Tuesday when we landed in Texas. We had to wait quite a while in the baggage claim area for the bike to be brought to us from the plane. We did not wait alone though, there were many people waiting to pick up their bikes for the race, and we continued to see them throughout the airport. One man I met was 70 years old this year and was going to complete his 10th Ironman. It was inspiring to see so many other people overcoming their own challenges to do the Ironman.

After the airport we got the bike put back together and it was making this clicking sound. We took it to a bike shop, and they took a look at it and determined there was something loose somewhere in the frame, but it was not mechanical and would not impact my race which was a relief to hear.

On Thursday we made it to The Woodlands where the race was going to take place, and the next two days I spent going through countless check-ins, gear drop offs, and I did a practice swim on Friday in the lake. Other than that, I was just resting for the race on Saturday.

Saturday came, my alarm went off at 5:00, and after getting my swim stuff ready we joined the line of thousands of people walking to the swim start. After standing in a sea of athletes with green and pink swim caps on I finally made it to the water and was off. It was so crowded in the water, especially as I entered the canal getting close to the end of the swim. During the bike the winds were 30 miles per hour strong and it was a struggle to move going south on the toll road. By mile 40 on the bike, I was exhausted from battling the wind, but I kept moving. Then I made it to mile 60, then 80, then 100, and I only had 12 miles left of the bike. It is amazing when you feel you can’t go any farther and then you do and slowly the miles go up and instead of stopping at mile 40 you are at the transition to the run. I continued slowly but surely all the way though the run, just one step at a time, until I made it to the finish line and the announcer said on the speakers “Aaron Beaupre, YOU ARE IRONMAN!”

This last week in Houston has been filled with excitement, nerves, pain, fear, happiness, relief, and so much more. I have overcome a broken arm and completed the 2.4 mile swim, 112 mile bike, and 26.2 mile run to become Ironman. It was an experience I will never forget.

## Becoming Ironman – Conclusion – 5/8/2024
Aaron B - **May 8, 2024 10:53 am**

As this project is coming to an end I would like to leave my final thoughts here.

Going into this project my goal was to complete the Ironman triathlon. I did just that, but I realized the project was not just about the race. It was about learning to work through struggles, enjoying the journey, and living in the present. There are things such as my broken arm that I could not have controlled. Things such as this that make already challenging things even that more challenging are inevitable throughout life. It is learning to accept these obstacles and find a way to get over them, it is about never giving up.

Many people say that they learn a lot from doing these long challenging events. Before this project I did not really believe that was true. Now, after having completed and Ironman while overcoming so many challenges on the way, I can say that you do truly learn a lot about yourself and what you are capable of throughout the whole process. This project is something that I will cherish forever and an experience that I will never forget. I will also take with me the fact that I am now an Ironman. The final product of this project is my finisher metal that shows the result of the last 20 weeks of sweat, blood, and tears. However, the final product is also me, and the growth I have had due to embarking on this journey.

I would like to thank my internal advisor, Mr. Robarge, and my external advisor, Deb Ledington, for providing me with guidance and support throughout the project. I would also like to thank my family for giving me their support. I cold not have done it without them. I will be presenting my final presentation tonight at Basis Flagstaff at 5:00 p.m.
