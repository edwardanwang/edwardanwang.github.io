		<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>

		<p>When faced with the decision of an invasive surgery versus modifying medical devices, physicians often choose to modify medical devices in off-label, or unapproved, ways. Due to this off-label use, companies, hospitals, and physicians face many legal liabilities and risks. To lower liability risks, physicians are able to submit a Physician Sponsored Investigational Device Exemption (PSIDE) for FDA approval. However, creating a PSIDE increases the physicians workload with what information needs to be supplied and approved. Creating a way to reduce barriers around PSIDEs is pertinent to allow for more immediate medical operation when there are no devices in a certain field. In order to find a way to make it easier for physicians to apply for PSIDE approval, I will be researching what companies can supply physicians for PSIDE approval on an individual basis and what consistent information can be provided overall for Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) approval. Doing research through W.L. Gore will allow me to create a meaningful solution in part with a company that supplies numerous medical devices. I am hoping to lower individual PSIDE requirements by creating a template on what information can consistently be provided and what companies can supply for individual cases while gaining experience working with W.L. Gore.</p>

			<p>Hello!</p>

			<p>My name is Avery, and I am a mountain biking, basketball playing, and ballet dancing senior at BASIS Flagstaff. For my research project, I will be taking a closer look at how companies can help lower physician requirements and workload around Physician Sponsored Investigational Device Exemptions (PSIDEs).</p>

			<p>What can we do when we need a medical device that does not yet exist?</p>

			<p>Well, there is the option of open surgery, increasing infection rate and recovery time. Or we can just wait to see how the problem develops. However, if there is a way to modify a current device to allow for the best outcome possible, many doctors will take it.</p>

			<p>This creates a separate issue: off-label use. Off-label use is unapproved use of any medical device or drug, but this is an incredibly broad term. Off-label use can include anything from a device slightly off size approval or a device that has a hole burned in it and is drastically altered. With off-label use, the physician subjects themselves, the hospital, and the device company to legal risk if something were to go wrong.</p>

			<p>Although this issue may seem like it has no way to be solved, physicians can take another route with PSIDEs. A PSIDE allows the physician to modify the medical device in an approved and monitored way while decreasing the legal risk of all the parties involved.</p>

			<p>However, PSIDE creation takes a great deal of work and time for the physician, so many physicians will opt for just off-label use. This is where my senior project steps in.</p>

			<p>To reduce the legal risk of all parties involved, companies, such as W.L. Gore (Gore), are interested in physicians utilizing devices as PSIDEs instead of being off-label. I will be researching how Gore and other companies are able to help lower individual PSIDE requirements for the physicians by creating a template on what information can consistently be provided and what information companies can supply for individual cases.</p>

			<p>For more information on my project, I have attached my senior project proposal below. I have also attached a photo of myself and of me mountain biking- my favorite hobby.</p>

			<h2 id="week1">Week 1: Meetings And Gathering Information</h2>
			<p><strong>February 27, 2024 9:51 pm</strong></p>

			<p>Hello again!</p>

			<p>This week I have been focusing on meetings with individuals who are familiar with Physician Sponsored Investigational Device Exemptions (PSIDEs) and Investigational Device Exemptions (IDEs) in general.</p>

			<p>Before these meetings, I have been looking into what their roles are that interact with PSIDEs and IDEs and reviewing available FDA information about IDEs and PSIDEs. From there, I have been creating questions to ask each individual in advance.</p>

			<p>So far this week, I met with Michael I., an aortic regulatory associate at W.L. Gore (Gore). For this meeting, I came up with the following questions:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>What is your role surrounding PSIDEs as a regulatory associate?</li>
				<li>What are your thoughts and the FDA’s thoughts surrounding PSIDEs?</li>
				<li>What do you believe is causing the biggest roadblock for physicians in IDE creation?</li>
				<li>What roadblocks have you seen with the FDA and Internal Review Boards (IRBs) around PSIDEs?</li>
				<li>What have you seen that does not work in PSIDE creation?</li>
				<li>What do you think would make a PSIDE or IDE process easier?</li>
				<li>Why does it seem that PSIDEs are being more encouraged now?</li>
				<li>Are there any approaches that you have seen work better in PSIDE or IDE creation?</li>
				<li>Why would a doctor choose to create a PSIDE instead of just operating off label?</li>
				<li>Does the FDA hint at ways an IDE should be created? Like say one way would be easier?</li>
				<li>Is this a US only thing or would it be easier or more difficult in other regulatory environments?</li>
				<li>Why is the FDA turning to more Real World Data (RWD) use?</li>
			</ol>

			<p>From our meeting, I learned quite a bit about PSIDEs and IDEs from a regulatory affairs standpoint. There are a couple areas that create barriers for PSIDE creation:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Technical Information
					<ul>
						<li>Physicians, when modifying a company device, often lack the technical information required to submit a PSIDE. This includes testing for the device or other publications to create reasonable assurances for no harm to patients. This is especially an issue when it comes to a device a physician modified themselves, as, in most cases, the benchtop testing has not ever been done, and, even if some has been done, there is often a lack of long-term durability testing data. This is understandable given physicians probably do not have the resources, skills, or time to design and complete the tests.</li>
						<li>For technical information on the already available device, physicians are able to request a letter from companies to submit to the FDA. This letter allows the FDA to access device master file documents on the medical device that are already on file with the FDA, so the FDA can have all the prior technical information on the device without sharing the device master file with the physician.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>End Goal
					<ul>
						<li>There needs to be an end goal with what can happen with the data gathered. Often, the end goal is device approval. However, there needs to be a certain number of follow-up patients with a sufficient length of follow up (example: 1 year follow up after the implant procedure) to allow for a statistical endpoint.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Another notable struggle surrounding PSIDEs is who owns the data and controls data usage on the device. With larger clinical trials, the company owns the data, and, if the device doesn’t work one way, they are able to put away that data for later use. With physicians owning the data, they are able to publish whatever they want surrounding the data they collected. This is worrisome for companies because it can taint the impression of information and put the company in a bad light, even if the physician was not following device protocol.</p>

			<p>Going forward this week, I am going to continue researching what creates issues around PSIDE creation and continue focusing on meetings and meeting preparation.</p>

			<h2 id="week2">Week 2: Processing Information</h2>
			<p><strong>March 6, 2024 9:58 am</strong></p>

			<p>Welcome back!</p>

			<p>In the past week, I have had a couple meetings that have revealed more information about how Investigational Device Exemptions (IDEs) and off-label use work in real-life situations.</p>

			<p>For my first meeting, I met with Bryan R., who is currently switching roles from a field sales associate to a clinical application specialist.</p>

			<p>During the meeting, Bryan started off by mentioning his process when he would help with Physician Modified Endo-Grafts (PMEGs) when a physician would want to modify one of Gore’s devices. Gore’s devices do not fit everyone’s anatomies and needs because every patient is different. There is no “one size fits all,” and, because of this, devices need to be utilized off-label or through a Physician Sponsored Investigational Device Exemption (PSIDE) at times.</p>

			<p>When asked (unprompted) by a physician, before considering modifying a device, Bryan would see if there was an on-label device made by another company for the same purpose. If not, that is when he would provide support to help with the PMEG cases.</p>

			<p>By providing support, Bryan provides technical knowledge, aid, and feedback for the physician modifying the device with what has been done before. He comments on what can be changed to the device to allow it to fit the patient correctly and successfully work for the patients’ needs.</p>

			<p>It is important to note that although Bryan provides support with PMEG cases, he is not promoting them and only acts in response to a physicians request.  The goal of providing support is to allow for the best outcome for the patient when there are no other alternative devices. Bryan also stated that he would not provide support for a case if he would not put his family on the table.</p>

			<p>Bryan also spoke to how off-label use has been viewed at companies like Gore in the past. Off-label use has been a taboo subject that many people would avoid talking about. Many people would not promote or support it. However, more recently, it has become less of a taboo subject.</p>

			<p>In my other meeting last week, I met with Alex A. who has recently began working in clinical affairs at Gore. However, at prior jobs, Alex worked as a study-coordinator and project manager with two IDEs. During our meeting, Alex discussed the issues he often encountered with the IDEs.</p>

			<p>The biggest encounter was the budget for the IDE. There were constant discussions on if they were over or under the budget, weighing options, and cutbacks. Although it is important to be aware of the budget, it is also important to ensure that there are not too many cutbacks that will affect the investigation.</p>

			<p>Another huge issue that Alex mentioned was managing and maintaining the IDE. There was a lack of understanding on what needed to be sent and updated with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the timeline of events, and how much the sponsor role in the IDE truly takes on.</p>

			<p>In the end, both Bryan and Alex agreed that PSIDEs should be encouraged. The people and physicians in their fields have lots of great ideas on medical advancement and often lack the means to implement a PSIDE. Also, the companies, physicians, and everyone in general can benefit from follow-up data on new ideas and techniques.</p>

			<p>Going forward through this week, I will continue meetings while researching solutions to help support the PSIDE process. At this point, I am thinking of a combination of educational training, templates, and algorithms.</p>

			<h2 id="week3">Week 3: Understanding Device Modification</h2>
			<p><strong>March 20, 2024 9:18 am</strong></p>

			<p>Hello again!</p>

			<p>This week I met with Bryan R. to talk about the process of device modification and why it is necessary with Physician Modified Endografts (PMEGs). Device modification is not condoned, but physicians will opt to do it if necessary.</p>

			<p>There is always going to be a reason for a physician to modify a device. Usually, it is one of two reasons:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The device does not fit the anatomy of the patient for what is being treated. The device may end before the area that needs treated ends. There are many reasons that a device may not fit anatomy. Every anatomy is different, and every patient is unique. For example, there is quite a bit of variation surrounding the distance and location of where vessels begin and end.</li>
				<li>The physician does not want to cover too many vessels. When using a device that covers more than the necessary area, the branching vessels, including intercostal vessels that lead to the spine, are covered as well, leading to a shortage of blood supply to those areas. If too many vessels are covered, the risk of paraplegia increases. In turn, physicians only want to cover what is needed.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>From there, Bryan walked me through the steps of device modification, presenting different fluoro-images and x-rays. Unfortunately, I cannot show them here, but the images presented different cases of device modification and why it was necessary in each case to treat the patients.</p>

			<p>When modifying the device, physicians contact the companies for guidance on what can and cannot be done to treat the patient. After discussing the options and deciding on what to alter, the device is set up for modification.</p>

			<p>Instead of opening the entire device, the device is opened to the end of what is being modified, secured by a slipknot and needle to stop deployment. Once open, the patient’s CT scan is referenced to decide where to put the modifications.</p>

			<p>With PMEGs, there are often two types of modifications:</p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>Fenestrations:</strong> holes in the devices. Fenestrations must be lined up perfectly in the patient in order to work.</li>
				<li><strong>Portals:</strong> inner branches. Portals can be maneuvered to fit properly in the branches and are easier to move around. These are very universal.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>After altering the device, wires are run through each fenestration and portal to align the device within the patient, and the shipping sheath is put back on to shrink down the device.</p>

			<p>It was fascinating to meet with Bryan and go in depth on device modification. It definitely displays how device modification and off-label use are necessary at times to treat the patient and why it is done so often. Going into the next week, I will be setting up and meeting with physicians who can shed more light on their experience with the Physician Sponsored Investigational Device (PSIDE) process. I will also continue researching the PSIDE requirements and process.</p>

			<h2 id="week4">Week 4: Where I’m Currently At</h2>
			<p><strong>March 26, 2024 11:19 am</strong></p>

			<p>Welcome back!</p>

			<p>Following spring break and picking up more work shifts this past week, I have not been up to too much, so I figured this week it would be good to talk about where I am at on my project and my ideas going forward.</p>

			<p>I have been compiling a document of problems with Physician Sponsored Investigational Device Exemptions (PSIDEs) and possible ways to solve or help present possible solutions.</p>

			<p>First off, for the overall guidance on PSIDEs, I am currently creating a PowerPoint with notes on how the PSIDE process works and tips to help with it. In addition, I will work on creating different templates to help with paperwork for a PSIDE proposal.</p>

			<p>I am trying to have this appeal to as many learning types as I can, so the PowerPoint in a meeting should appeal to both visual and auditory learners. Kinesthetic learners are a little trickier, so I am going to recommend taking notes for that certain presentation.</p>

			<p>Furthermore, I am going to attempt to incorporate an algorithm and a checklist to help physicians keep track of where they are in the process and what needs to be done.</p>

			<p>With the budget issue, that is often ran into with PSIDEs, I am thinking about linking a template that Gore has for grant proposals. From there, I will recommend checking out Gore’s grant website and submitting a request. This will allow it to be open to everyone and not solely for a targeted audience. However, I still need to meet with someone from the grants department to solidify what I am and am not able to do with grants.</p>

			<p>The trickier issue at hand is with durability testing. I will mention in my presentation that the testing is necessary in order to fulfill the needed technical information. I am working on figuring out if I am able to recommend places I find online and say that we have not vetted the different companies. However, I am still working through that one.</p>

			<p>In the end, I hope to have a google drive compiled with all of the resources I create to help with the PSIDE process.</p>

			<p>That’s all for this week folks!</p>

			<h2 id="week5">Week 5</h2>
			<p><strong>April 3, 2024 9:23 am</strong></p>

			<p>Hello again!</p>

			<p>This week has been more independent work and meeting preparation for weeks to come, so I will keep this post shorter than the others!</p>

			<p>I have been setting up meetings for the upcoming weeks. Later this week on Thursday at 2 pm, I will be meeting with one of the two physicians. I scheduled to meet the second physician on April 12. In preparation, I have been creating different questions to ask the physicians and see what support for Physician Sponsored Investigational Device Exemptions (PSIDEs) will be useful or what information would be helpful to know in advance.</p>

			<p>For other meetings, I have been working to set up a meeting with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to see what support companies like Gore are able to provide among other things. I have also been setting up a meeting with the grants team at Gore to see what financial support places like Gore are able to provide with physician sponsored investigational device exemptions.</p>

			<p>In addition to setting up the meetings, I have started working on the physician sponsored investigational device exemption creation and maintenance power point for physicians. So far, I have been including the cost of physician sponsored investigational device exemptions, the definitions, and different ways a physician sponsored investigational device exemption is needed. It is still in the development phase, but I am happy with the progress I have made at this point.</p>

			<p>I should have more for this next week because I will have the meetings to talk about in the blog post. However, at this point, this is all I have for this week.</p>

			<h2 id="week6">Week 6</h2>
			<p><strong>April 10, 2024 8:57 am</strong></p>

			<p>Good morning!</p>

			<p>This week has been productive. However, it has not necessarily gone to plan. The physician I was planning on meeting with on Thursday had a personal conflict, so we had to schedule it for this week. Secondly, when I went to publish my first blog post, everything deleted itself, so here we go for trial 2!</p>

			<p>Since I do not have too much going on, I will lay out how the rest of my week will look like:</p>

			<p>On Thursday, I will be meeting with an individual from the Gore grants team. I am hoping to find out how and if the grants at Gore are able to financially help physicians start and maintain a Physician Sponsored Investigational Device Exemption (PSIDE). From my meetings so far, I have found that the budget is one of the bigger challenges in the PSIDE process, so I am hoping to find a way for physicians to gain financial support.</p>

			<p>After meeting with grants on Thursday, I will jump from that meeting to meet with a physician who has gone through the PSIDE process. I am hoping to explore his experiences with creating and maintaining a PSIDE and find out what would have been beneficial to know when beginning and going through the PSIDE process.</p>

			<p>Throughout the day on Thursday, I will continue working on my PSIDE creation and maintenance Power Point. As this is a pretty large and information packed presentation, it is taking me quite a bit to put it all together. If I manage to get through most of that presentation on Thursday, then I will begin working on the final presentation for my senior project.</p>

			<p>Lastly, on Friday morning, I will be meeting with a second physician who has gone through the PSIDE process. I will be asking him similar questions to the questions I will be asking the physician on Thursday, and I am excited to see what information I will gain from the meeting.</p>

			<p>I am looking forward to seeing how much progress I will have by the end of this week.</p>

			<p>Thank you for reading! Have a great rest of your week and weekend!</p>

		<div>
			<h2 id="week7-1">Week 7 Part 1</h2>
			<p><strong>April 17, 2024 8:42 am</strong></p>

			<p>Hello everyone!</p>

			<p>This past week has definitely kept me busy! I met with two different physicians, the Gore grants coordinator, and reviewed everything with my external advisor. Thank you to everyone I have been meeting with; you have been a huge help in this process!</p>

			<p>Because I have more content than usual (and because I need another blog post to fulfill my requirements), I am going to be posting two blog posts this week. This one will be going over the grants process and Physician Sponsored Investigational Device Exemption (PSIDE) aid while the second one will cover the discussions with the two physicians.</p>

			<p>To begin with, I met with Samantha C., the Gore grants coordinator, to discuss possible financial options for PSIDEs. At the beginning of our meeting, Sam dove into how Gore’s grants process worked.</p>

			<p>Gore has switched to have a very user friendly portal system for grant applications. On the website, there are templates for how to set up a grant, the portal link, program criteria, and so much more.</p>

			<p>Once creating a login on the portal, anyone is able to begin the grant application. The grant application portal is the same as the paper form that Gore required in the past, so it is easy to understand or paste any information into. If there is any trouble, Sam C. recommends emailing the grants team at Gore, and someone on the team will gladly jump on a call to help whoever is applying for a grant walk through the application.</p>

			<p>From there, we discussed what Gore grants often support. As it turns out, there are 3 main categories:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Fellowship Grants</li>
				<li>Educational Grants</li>
				<li>Research Grants</li>
			</ol>

			<p>At Gore, the bulk of the grants is educational. From a PSIDE standpoint, physicians are either looking for educational grants or research grants depending on the requested aid. Research grants typically request more aid than educational grants. However, Gore is willing to fully or partially support grant requests depending on what the request is. It is encouraged to ask for the needed amount in a study.</p>

			<p>Within grant applications, Gore is typically looking for clinical, scientific, or healthcare topics within the therapeutic areas that Gore supports. They are really looking to individuals or companies demonstrating how to make medicine better, often pairing perfectly with PSIDEs.</p>

			<p>When reviewing applications, applications often miss highlighting why Gore should fund the grant. This creates the grant request to be less appealing when reviewing because it can be difficult to support a request when you have to search out the value.</p>

			<p>Overall, I am planning on recommending creating and submitting a grant application for a PSIDE in my PSIDE creation and maintenance Power Point. It was an awesome opportunity to dive into how the grants work at Gore.</p>

			<p>Thanks for reading this week’s first blog post!</p>

		<div>
			<h2 id="week7-2">Week 7 Part 2</h2>
			<p><strong>April 17, 2024 1:01 pm</strong></p>

			<p>Hey again!</p>

			<p>To recap, in my first blog post this week, I discussed the Gore grants process and the meeting I had with the Gore grants coordinator, Sam C. For this post, I am going over my meetings with physicians from this past week.</p>

			<p>For these meetings, I met with Dr. Patrick K. and Dr. Mark F. Both physicians have been running Physician Sponsored Investigational Device Exemptions (PSIDEs) for well over a decade, so they both had great insight into the PSIDE process.</p>

			<p>For starters, both physicians commented on how much work a PSIDE was to begin and mainly maintain, especially with the annual progress report for the FDA. When there were only a couple people enrolled in the PSIDE, the annual progress report was only around 15 pages. As their PSIDE enrollments grew, so did the annual progress report. With about 200 people enrolled in the study, Dr. K. reported having the annual progress report around 2000 pages. At this point, I am not entirely sure how to help with the annual progress report side of the PSIDE process, but I am trying to think of a couple different ways.</p>

			<p>From there, Dr. K. and Dr. F. both agreed that money was the biggest problem when running a PSIDE. Dr. F.’s PSIDE consumed $.25 million per year while Dr. K. would spend around $150k per year on his PSIDE. With more patients, there was more workload, so each PSIDE had to hire more staff, especially with data collection and analysis. Because money is often an issue with PSIDEs, I am putting a section about grants and grant applications in my PSIDE creation and maintenance Power Point.</p>

			<p>While both physicians decided to go the PSIDE route, Dr. K. and Dr. F. differed on their views. Dr. F. enjoyed running his PSIDE, although it was a great deal of work, because it satisfied his desire for research and being able to treat various patients. On the other hand, Dr. K. described the PSIDE as more of a “means to an end” in order to eventually gain device approval.</p>

			<p>From there, I asked about the technical and durability information about each PSIDE device. Dr. F. did not have to show more technical information other than the device master file that the FDA had on hand. Meanwhile, Dr. K. was able to rent testing equipment from Medtronic and complete various strength tests on his devices. I am hoping to talk more with Gore about the possibility of renting testing equipment for physicians as well.</p>

			<p>Towards the end, I asked both physicians what would have been useful when first going through the process. Both agreed that templates for creating the IDE application would have been useful and that further grant opportunities would be beneficial, as the cost continues to increase.</p>

			<p>Keeping their experiences with PSIDEs in mind, I am continuously working on my Power Point and resources for physicians interested in PSIDEs.</p>

			<p>That’s all I have for this week, thanks for reading!</p>

			<p><strong>April 24, 2024 8:58 am</strong></p>

			<p>Good morning!</p>

			<p>This week has definitely been a busy one for me. On top of working on the project, I have been working and preparing for the Whiskey Off-Road mountain bike race. These next 3 weeks and weekends will be busy, as they will be filled with races, senior project preparation and presentation, AP testing, and work. On top of that, though, I have still been productive.</p>

			<p>We set up the final meeting that I will have. I am meeting with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Friday! I am excited to have this opportunity, and I have been preparing for the meeting for a couple weeks. I have created a list of questions that Michael I. (the individual from the week 1 blog post) and Roberta B. (my external advisor) have helped me narrow down and adjust the questions to be more concise.</p>

			<p>Secondly, I have been doing a lot of Power Point work. I have continued working on the Physician Sponsored Investigational Device Exemption (PSIDE) Creation and Maintenance Power Point, and I am getting close to the final product for that. I need to make a couple more slides and go through the presentation to make sure it runs smoothly and has all the necessary information.</p>

			<p>Lastly, I have began working on my Senior Project Presentation Power Point. This one still has a ways to go until it is complete and ready for presentation, but I plan to have it ready to go by next Thursday. I am about a quarter of the way through the presentation at this point.</p>

			<p>Heading into the final weeks, I am excited to see how everyone’s presentations, including mine, are coming together. That is all I have to blog about for this week.</p>

			<p><strong>May 1, 2024 9:19 am</strong></p>

			<p>Hello everyone!</p>

			<p>This week has been pretty eventful as we are coming to a close with our senior projects. On the senior project end of things, I have been working on presentations and had an informal interview with a FDA representative.</p>

			<p>I was curious about how views and thoughts surrounding Physician Sponsored Investigational Device Exemptions (PSIDEs) varied based on the role (i.e. physician, regulatory affairs, and FDA), so many of my questions were similar to a lot of my other interviews.</p>

			<p>I will begin by going over the FDA’s role in IDEs and PSIDEs.</p>

			<p>As a whole, the FDA regulates medical devices, but they do not want to control medicine as a whole. Their goal is to promote patient safety along with medical innovation. PSIDEs and IDEs allow both of these goals to be satisfied, as the FDA is carefully watching the safety for the patients enrolled in the IDE studies while allowing companies or physicians to meet unmet patient needs through the IDE or PSIDE.</p>

			<p>The FDA does see different results between PSIDEs and IDEs. Because physicians and their teams do not have as many resources as large medical companies, it is difficult for the FDA to hold the PSIDEs and IDEs to the same standard with topics like device testing. For this reason, many PSIDEs utilize available, appropriate information and physician experience in the subject surrounding their PSIDE.</p>

			<p>Because it can be difficult to justify safety for some PSIDEs, the FDA can request more reports and be able to monitor the situation. The FDA is also able to request inspections for documents and outcomes if they feel it is needed. Being under a PSIDE allows for greater patient safety monitoring than a physician operating off-label allows for.</p>

			<p>I also asked about what typically does not work with PSIDEs as seen from the FDA’s side. As it turns out, really novel approaches with little or no evidence to support the IDE proposal typically does not allow the PSIDE to move forward. The FDA has no way of being comfortable with novel ideas that have no evidence backing them. Another difficulty often seen is a PSIDE having any major patient safety concerns or reporting concerns. Again, patient safety is a huge part of what the FDA is looking for and clear reporting is necessary to ensure this.</p>

			<p>Another necessary component to be clear about is the PSIDE or IDE goal. The purpose of an IDE is to gain device approval and bring the devices to the market. The FDA does not have the resources for a ton of IDEs, so they want a clear purpose for the IDE. A PSIDE is not for the sole purpose of operating off-label.</p>

			<p>From there I asked about what the FDA believes what companies are able to provide physicians. A huge component companies are able to provide is technical input about the device along with creating open dialogue between the physicians, FDA, and the company itself.</p>

			<p>Overall, the FDA supports the purposeful creation of PSIDEs and IDEs, as they want to promote medical innovation and provide monitoring for patient safety.</p>

			<p>Hello all!</p>

			<p>Thank you for those who have been following my blog posts and to those who attended my senior project presentation! I appreciate all of the support throughout this process.</p>

			<p>Overall, with my project, I feel that I was able to make many great connections with people who I otherwise would not have had the chance to meet. I believe their input has helped make this presentation for physician (Physician Sponsored Investigational Device Exemption) PSIDE  support a possibility with the best focus possible.</p>

			<p>I was able to focus on recommendations and solutions with grants, device testing, a different way to learn FDA PSIDE information, and any tips and tricks along with what to focus on along the way. I hope this will be helpful to any individuals looking to create a PSIDE and be able to help with anything that is difficult to understand or could have been over looked.</p>

			<p>In the end, my Power Point ended up being 40 slides with a script in the notes for each slide. It took more time than I anticipated to put the slideshow together, but I believe it turned out great in the end. I have the Power Point attached below as well if you would like to check it out :).</p>

			<p>I also have my senior project presentation slides attached below as well.</p>

			<p>Lastly, I wanted to give a huge thank you to everyone who helped me participate in my project, especially W.L. Gore and Associates for giving me the opportunity to take on this project and my advisors, Roberta B. and Bert L. I couldn’t have done it without your help.</p>

			<p>Thank you all for reading the last post!</p>
