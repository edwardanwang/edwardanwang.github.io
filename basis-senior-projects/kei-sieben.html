		<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>

		<p>Trauma victims can bleed out in minutes, often before an ambulance arrives. After the uptick in U.S. mass shootings, programs like ‚ÄúStop the Bleed‚Äù were created across the country, based on military tourniquet techniques. Such programs ensure that bystanders are trained to be able to stop bleeding when emergency personnel may take too long. Despite widespread training program installation, prior research reveals challenges in bystander efficacy during emergencies. I aim to build on that research and specifically work on implementing the improvements in my own city of Flagstaff. Because of my focus on ‚ÄúStop the Bleed‚Äù programs in Flagstaff, I have decided to collaborate with the team at Northern Arizona Healthcare Trauma center who has a team currently providing training all across Flagstaff. This will ensure me direct access to resources and will aid in implementing research findings for immediate impact. I will also be partnering with my peer Sarah W., which allows us to broaden our goals; she&#39;ll handle survey design and distribution as an intern, while I focus on analysis and research. My research aims to identify obstacles and propose enhancements for program effectiveness based on the results of her survey. We have chosen surveys as our method of research as it will reach a large audience of trained and prospective individuals during our research period. Overall, I aim to identify ways training programs have fallen short in reaching their audience and contribute to a revised program, ensuring that bystanders feel prepared and confident in addressing emergencies.</p>

			<h2 id="week0">Let‚Äôs Stop The Bleed: Introductory Post: February 21st</h2>
			<p><strong>February 21, 2024 12:00 pm</strong></p>

			<h3 id="hello">Hello!</h3>

			<p>For the next 10 weeks I will be researching the efficacy of Stop the Bleed Training programs in Northern Arizona using survey data. Stop the Bleed Training Programs are bystander-focused quick training programs focused on teaching how to use a tourniquet, apply pressure, and pack a wound. I will be working together with BASIS senior <strong><a title="Link unavailable">Sarah W</a></strong>, my internal advisor: <strong>Trent M: Head of Operations</strong>, as well as numerous on-site advisors at Northern Arizona Healthcare: <strong>Shawn B: Injury Prevention/Outreach Coordinator</strong>, <strong>Paula G: IRB Administrator</strong>, <strong>Floye B: Director of Quality</strong>, <strong>Sedona S: Public Health Intern</strong>. We are researching the efficacy of Stop the Bleed Training programs in Northern Arizona using survey data.</p>

			<h3 id="but-first-a-little-about-me">But first, a little about me:</h3>

			<p>My name is Kei S. and I‚Äôm a senior at Basis Flagstaff. I‚Äôve been interested in the medical field for as long as I can remember and I‚Äôve always wanted to go into diagnostic medicine. However, when Northern Arizona Healthcare reached out to our school about a project on Trauma and Emergency Medicine, I became fascinated with the emergency medicine side of things. I hope this project will serve me well to get a proper insight into the research side of medicine.</p>

			<h3 id="about-my-project">About my project:</h3>

			<p>I will work together with Sarah to see the efficacy and retention rate of Stop the Bleed training programs throughout Flagstaff. These programs are designed for bystanders to be able to provide basic emergency care till EMS is able to arrive. Sarah W. will be working as an intern for her Senior Project and is focusing more on survey design and analyzing how to make an effective survey. She will be learning on-site how to create a survey that will provide us with the most helpful information. I will primarily be using that survey data to analyze how these training programs can be made more effective and help with retention rates.</p>

			<h3 id="why-is-this-so-important-to-study">Why is this so important to study?:</h3>

			<p>Throughout my talks with my on-site advisors and through literature review I have recognized the importance of bystander training: Trauma victims can bleed out in less than 5 minutes, while an ambulance takes an average of 7 minutes to arrive on-scene. Prior research shows that while training programs are designed well, there is a lack of proper retention and understanding post-training. I aim to provide the hospital with the resources to help close the knowledge gap. Time-dependent I hope to provide supplementary educational materials that the hospital can use in their program.</p>

			<h2 id="week1">Let‚Äôs Stop The Bleed: Week 1: February 28th</h2>
			<p><strong>February 28, 2024 12:00 pm</strong></p>

			<p>Hello everyone, welcome back!</p>

			<p>My first week has been off to an exciting start!</p>

			<h3 id="heres-a-bit-of-an-overview-of-what-ive-been-doing-this-first-week"><span style="color:orangered;">Here‚Äôs a bit of an overview of what I‚Äôve been doing this first week:</span></h3>

			<ul>
				<li>Me and my fellow hospital project friends (Aiyana, Delaney, Nathan, Sarah, and Sedona) had an introductory meeting with most of the hospital personnel who will be helping us with various portions of our project. It was a little scary to introduce my project plans in front of so many professionals üòÇ. We kept re-introducing ourselves each time a new person popped in, by the time the CEO walked in I was getting the hang of things!</li>
				<li>Sarah and I worked on sorting emails and names onto a spreadsheet from rosters of people who‚Äôve attended Stop the Bleed training programs. We had a whopping 653 people from the last 3 years. I definitely did not expect the amount of time it took to write everyone‚Äôs emails down. (Took about 12 hours between the 2 of us)</li>
				<li>A researcher at NAH, Alejandra, taught us how to do what is called an Evidence Table for Evidence Based Practice: This is essentially a way to incorporate research findings into clinical settings. It‚Äôs used very commonly with nurses to help provide better care to patients. My Evidence Table includes my 12 sources from my initial literature review, and describes key findings from each research paper. I‚Äôve attached it here: <a href="kei-sieben/evidence-table.pdf">Evidence Table: Stop the Bleed</a></li>
			</ul>

			<h3 id="heres-a-sneak-peek-into-what-i-plan-to-work-on-next-week"><span style="color:orange;">Here‚Äôs a sneak-peek into what I plan to work on next week:</span></h3>

			<ul>
				<li>Sarah will be working on planning out survey questions and getting it ready to send out hopefully by next Monday. Meanwhile I will be doing a literature review on qualitative analysis. Ideally, I will make an Evidence Table for these as well.</li>
				<li>I will have meetings with my external advisors to go over how my project is going along. </li>
				<li>I will also be meeting with Alejandra F. to go over survey evaluation and qualitative analysis. At this point Sarah will hopefully have a good idea of the questions, so I can plan out how I‚Äôm going to approach analyzing our questions.</li>
				<li>I will hopefully educate myself about Excel. We‚Äôre hopefully going to have good feedback for the survey, which we will then sort into Excel. Having such a large quantity of potential respondents, it‚Äôs important for me to have a good idea of how to navigate it before it‚Äôs flooded with data.</li>
				<li>Until the actual survey results come in, I‚Äôm primarily going to be using the survey questions to figure out how I can best analyze. Hopefully once those start to come in, things will start moving more quickly.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 id="my-biggest-difficulty-this-week"><span style="color:limegreen;">My biggest difficulty this week:</span></h3>

			<ul>
				<li>Surprisingly my biggest difficulty was something so simple: inputting names and emails into our spreadsheet. Most of the rosters were filled in with handwriting vs typing. I was dumbfounded by how horrible people‚Äôs handwriting was! Something I definitely think would be good to think of in the future is to print the attendee‚Äôs names out beforehand, and have them sign in to show that they have attended, rather than have them hand write their information out.</li>
				<li>I also was in desperate need of a lamp for our workspace, hopefully that will get worked out soon!</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 id="non-project-related-endeavors"><span style="color:blue;">Non-project related endeavors:</span></h3>

			<ul>
				<li>I finally got my CPR certification this Saturday! This means I‚Äôll be able to also become a Stop the Bleed instructor sometime during this project if I have extra time.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>See you next week!</p>

			<h2 id="week2">Let‚Äôs Stop The Bleed: Week 2: March 6th</h2>
			<p><strong>March 6, 2024 12:00 pm</strong></p>

			<p>Hi everyone, welcome to the end of week 2!</p>

			<h3 id="heres-an-overview-of-what-i-did-this-week"><span style="color:purple;">Here‚Äôs an overview of what I did this week:</span></h3>

			<p>Long story short: Lots of meetings!</p>

			<ul>
				<li>I had a meeting with Alejandra F, the quality improvement program manager at Northern Arizona Healthcare (NAH) to go over how to do qualitative analysis. I showed her the rough draft of survey questions that Sarah W. created, and went over how to use the data that will come out from it.</li>
				<li>I also had a meeting with Floye B, Sedona S, and Shawn B to go over how the survey is coming along. We made some minor changes in format and layout, such as which questions should come first, which are more important, etc.</li>
				<li>I also had a meeting with the rest of the hospital projects to go over how to interview people we‚Äôre researching. I will likely not be doing many interviews on trainees from Stop the Bleed training programs, however Shawn B, the Injury Prevention/Outreach Coordinator at Trauma Services, can hopefully get us in contact with a victim whose father saved his life with a tourniquet, which would be greatly informative.</li>
				<li>I also had a meeting with Paula M., the IRB Administrator, she got us all set up with computers from IT and got our log-ins. If I‚Äôve learned anything so far, it‚Äôs that phone calls are essential to getting things running ü§£.</li>
				<li>My major focus this week (besides house-keeping meetings) was getting myself knowledgeable about qualitative analysis. I researched 10 articles to kind of get myself versed with how I can go about analyzing our survey data.
					<ul>
						<li>This is my basic summary from the process:
							<ul>
								<li>There‚Äôs a very large range of approaches ranging from analyzing texts to interpreting people‚Äôs personal narratives.</li>
								<li>Categorizing responses is crucial for organizing data. Essentially when it comes to free-response questions, it‚Äôs important to lump things into categories. An example of this would be if we ask someone to describe their occupation, we could get answers such as teacher or professor, and we would group those into one category for ease of analysis.</li>
								<li>It‚Äôs best to work in tandem with someone. Qualitative analysis can be very subjective compared to quantitative analysis. While our survey will include both types of analysis, a large portion will be free-response needing qualitative analysis. Adding a person to bounce ideas off of is super important to try and keep analysis objective.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 id="heres-my-plan-for-the-following-week"><span style="color:purple;">Here‚Äôs my plan for the following week:</span></h3>

			<ul>
				<li>I would‚Äôve liked to get more skilled with Excel this week as well as understanding how SurveyMonkey will sort out our survey responses. However, I got carried away with meetings and qualitative analysis research. My hope is to get myself acquainted with those two things.</li>
				<li>I also need to work on getting Hospital IRB approval. While we already submitted an IRB to BASIS we need to do one specifically for the hospital.</li>
				<li>Sarah W. and I will hopefully be able to send out the surveys by the end of this week. We haven‚Äôt figured out an ideal way to prevent it from being flagged as spam seeing as we‚Äôre sending it to over 600 people. As a result we will likely have to spend a bit of time sending them out in small batches.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 id="my-biggest-obstacle-this-week"><span style="color:purple;">My biggest obstacle this week:</span></h3>

			<ul>
				<li>My biggest difficulty was setting up NAH logins. Obviously, the hospital takes security very seriously, as such, it was difficult to get our laptops set up with our hospital login information and Duo Authentication.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 id="extra-information-1"><span style="color:purple;">Extra Information:</span></h3>

			<p>I‚Äôve been super busy the past few weeks, but while waiting for survey results to come back next week I‚Äôm hoping I‚Äôll have the time to discuss more of what the experience has been like versus just a description of what I‚Äôve been up to. I‚Äôm also hoping to discuss some different things next week such as what a daily day is like at the research and trauma offices and how the project has slowly changed as I‚Äôve spent more time with it.</p>

			<h2 id="week3">Let‚Äôs Stop The Bleed: Week 3: March 13th</h2>
			<p><strong>March 13, 2024 12:00 pm</strong></p>

			<p>Hi everyone, welcome to the middle of spring break!</p>

			<h3 id="heres-an-overview-of-what-i-did-this-week-1"><span style="color:purple;">Here‚Äôs an overview of what I did this week.</span></h3>

			<p>At the beginning of this week I focused on IRB related things while also having meetings to fully finalize the survey. The IRB turned out to be both very similar to the IRB we did for BASIS but simultaneously very different?? It was essentially a short form with questions about our project, whether or not it posed a risk for participants, we had to upload a copy of our survey as well. </p>

			<p>Because it‚Äôs spring break, I also took a bit of a break from our project. Sarah and I had the opportunity to sign up for shadowing hours at North Country Healthcare with the Family Medicine Residents in accordance with our Future Faces of Family Medicine program. It was an amazing experience to be able to have patient interaction and see what medicine is like from the provider‚Äôs perspective. The Family Medicine clinic is Resident based (Residents have graduated medical school and are completing additional training, and Attendings are board-certified physicians who have already completed residency) so after seeing a patient we would go back to a little office to discuss with the Attending a plan-of-care after which the Attending went back into the patient‚Äôs room to finalize plans with the patient. It was amazing to see the amount of collaboration between not only Residents and Attendings, but also with the Medical Assistants who help get the patient settled, run tests, and take vitals. </p>

			<h3 id="heres-my-plan-for-the-following-week-1"><span style="color:purple;">Here‚Äôs my plan for the following week:</span></h3>

			<p>I‚Äôm going to finish up spring break with some more shadowing at North Country, and at the start of next week I‚Äôll be helping Sarah send out our survey emails. We ultimately decided to wait on sending them out for a couple reasons 1. We have to wait for IRB approval and 2. Most of Northern Arizona is on spring break, and we didn‚Äôt want that to affect survey response. We also wanted to kind of get all of our ducks in order: Finalizing survey questions without a rush, Drafting a concise email explaining what this is for, and Planning on how to best send out the emails. Next week is definitely going to be very busy with the sending out of surveys, and probably getting a few response as well.</p>

			<h3 id="my-biggest-obstacle-this-week-1"><span style="color:purple;">My biggest obstacle this week:</span></h3>

			<p>The hardest thing this week was definitely just setting up the IRB website. I think I‚Äôm starting to find a theme ü§£, technology is going to be my biggest struggle. Essentially, the website didn‚Äôt love the idea that I had a gmail account, so we had to set up NAHealth emails which ended up not being able to receive any mail, so we had to go and try gmail again.</p>

			<h3 id="a-day-in-the-life"><span style="color:purple;">A day in the life!</span></h3>

			<p>Now that we‚Äôve all kind of gotten settled into the swing of things, I‚Äôd thought I could share what my days have been looking like! We‚Äôve been attending the office on Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday from 9 a.m. ‚Äì 1 p.m. with a lunch break from 11:30-12:00. This time is composed of meetings and project-related things that are nice to have support with. For example, setting up computers and IRB set-up require us to be in the office. Mondays we typically have a check-in meeting with one of our main advisors Floye B., where we go over our plans for the upcoming week and get her advice and support. Wednesdays we typically have a specific Stop the Bleed meeting with either Sedona S. or Shawn B. to go over anything related to surveys. Thursdays are for learning-based meetings. Each week we have something new to learn, in past weeks it was about qualitative research and what IRBs are. Next week we will go over the basics of Excel. Tuesdays are our meetings with Ms. Cohen at school to go over blog posts.</p>

			<p>Though we don‚Äôt spend a lot of time in the office, I really like to work at home to do a lot of the more individual tasks (I essentially use the office as more collaboration and home for more individual focused tasks). For example, I write my blog posts once I get home on Tuesday afternoon. Responding to blog comments also happens from home.</p>

			<p>I know this was a pretty long post, thanks for reading! Or skimming ü§£</p>

			<h2 id="week4">Let‚Äôs Stop The Bleed: Week 4: March 20th</h2>
			<p><strong>March 20, 2024 12:00 pm</strong></p>

			<p>Hi everyone, welcome to Week 4!</p>

			<h3 id="heres-an-overview-of-what-i-did-this-week-2"><span style="color:purple;">Here‚Äôs an overview of what I did this week.</span></h3>

			<p>This week was the end of Spring Break+2 days, so I honestly haven‚Äôt gotten a lot accomplished project related. However! I got stitches for the first time, and a full-ride to a college!</p>

			<p>But back to the project:</p>

			<h4 id="excel-stuff">Excel Stuff:</h4>

			<p>On Monday we met with Alejandra F, the quality improvement program manager at Northern Arizona Healthcare (NAH), who we also met a couple weeks back to learn about qualitative analysis. She gave us a short presentation on Excel! I tried to get myself accustomed to it prior to the meeting, but unfortunately my computer doesn‚Äôt have Excel, and google sheets just don‚Äôt have the same capacity for analysis.</p>

			<p>This is a basic summary of what I learned:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>All columns are variables. For example: each survey question would be a new column</li>
				<li>All rows are ‚Äúcases‚Äù. These would be observations, or in my case, survey responses.</li>
				<li>You can add categories in new columns to sort your data. For example if you have one column with responses to a question about what you ate for breakfast that day. You could have a new column sorting those responses into beverage/solid food. But it‚Äôs super important to make sure you make it identifiable that that‚Äôs not part of the original data set.</li>
				<li>You should always keep a master copy of your spreadsheet so that if you make changes to make it easier to view/analyze there‚Äôs something you can go back to.</li>
				<li>Filters are one of the easiest ways to organize quickly. They will create drop-downs based on your data, and you can filter to only show something such as only look at solid food, or only look at beverages.</li>
				<li>Pivot Tables: You can choose a range of data to make into a simplified table. It takes very complex spreadsheet data and simplifies it down into a way that‚Äôs easy to look at. You can drag different variables into columns, rows, and filters for it to show the data differently. None of this affects the raw data.</li>
				<li>PivotTable Analyze: This feature will make a chart that is tied to your PivotTable that shows your data in a more visual manner.</li>
				<li>And most important in my opinion: No completely blank columns or rows. None of your data can be analyzed by Excel if there are full rows missing because it views it as not a full data set.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4 id="surveyemail-progress">Survey/Email Progress:</h4>

			<p>Sarah and I have finished setting up all the emails to send out to all our recipients. All we‚Äôre waiting on is final IRB approval before we can officially hit send.</p>

			<h3 id="heres-my-plan-for-the-following-week-2"><span style="color:purple;">Here‚Äôs my plan for the following week:</span></h3>

			<p>Survey results should be coming in pretty quickly after things are sent out. I expect to get a fair amount of responses in the first couple of days, and then have it taper out. We will then send it out once or twice more in the coming weeks to see if we can get more results.</p>

			<p>Some of our emails are likely to bounce back just because handwriting made it difficult to decipher their addresses. I hope to go back and see if we can try and re-decipher them if need be.</p>

			<h3 id="my-biggest-obstacle-this-week-2"><span style="color:purple;">My biggest obstacle this week:</span></h3>

			<p>There was nothing that was an obvious obstacle. I think the difficult thing with sending out emails to such a large number of people in small batches is making sure that you included all of the information in each one, attached all the right things, and that the survey link is working.</p>

			<h3 id="how-is-the-workplace-different-than-i-expected"><span style="color:purple;">How is the workplace different than I expected?</span></h3>

			<p>Honestly I went in with very little expectations about the workplace, maybe that Sarah and I would be isolated from the other hospital project students? I figured we‚Äôd all be doing our own thing and that it might get a bit lonely. However, we have meetings together multiple times a week so I feel like I have a really good grasp on what we‚Äôre all doing with our different projects. We also make time to eat lunch and decompress each day at the office which has been super nice.</p>

			<h2 id="week5">Let‚Äôs Stop The Bleed: Week 5: March 27th</h2>
			<p><strong>March 27, 2024 12:00 pm</strong></p>

			<p>Hi everyone, welcome to Week 5!</p>

			<h3 id="heres-an-overview-of-what-i-did-this-week-3"><span style="color:purple;">Here‚Äôs an overview of what I did this week.</span></h3>

			<p>Surveys were distributed! This was a whole process in and of itself‚Ä¶.who knew distributing 650 emails would be so hard!! Well I did, but it still turned out to be more frustrating than I thought. We essentially organized our roster of 650 people into groups of 50 to send in small batches. Sarah and I split the work in half, each sending Paula M. 6 emails worth of people. Each email contained a list of people, the body of the email, and the attached Informed Consent document. We made sure to check each email to ensure it had the correct link to the survey, but alas one of them still happened to be the incorrect link. Essentially, I sent Paula a master-copy of the email, and Informed Consent, which had an old link to the survey. This is the copy that ended up being sent to the first half of people before Paula noticed. Thankfully we were able to send them a revised copy before too many people noticed! </p>

			<p>After the surveys were emailed out, we had to deal with the bad email addresses. Sometimes all the emails that bounced back were nicely put in one convenient email, but a lot of them came back individually. This meant that Sarah and I had to sort them all out, and make note of which emails were bounced back, so we don‚Äôt send them out again when we send a follow-up this week. I only managed to sort for a little over an hour before I became exasperated, thank you to Sarah for getting everything nice and organized!</p>

			<h3 id="here-are-the-current-statistics-of-return-rates-for-the-survey"><span style="color:purple;">Here are the current statistics of return rates for the survey.</span></h3>

			<ul>
				<li><p>We had 652 noted attendees who signed in on our rosters.</p></li>
				<li><p>590 wrote down their emails.</p></li>
				<li><p>504 emails were successfully sent out and didn‚Äôt bounce back</p></li>
				<li><p>45 responses have been received</p></li>
			</ul>

			<p>Hopefully we‚Äôll receive more than 45 üòÇ but it‚Äôs not a bad start! We‚Äôll be sending out a follow-up email sometime this week as a reminder to hopefully get some more responses.</p>

			<h3 id="heres-my-plan-for-the-following-week-3"><span style="color:purple;">Here‚Äôs my plan for the following week:</span></h3>

			<p>I know I‚Äôve been talking about Excel for a while now, but it‚Äôs so much more complicated than I thought, and as we receive more and more responses, I‚Äôm starting to realize I have my work cut out for me. I‚Äôve already started with sorting out some of the free-response data and finding themes within the answers. However, as soon as I started trying out PivotTables I realized that I was just completely lost‚Ä¶all my Excel research ended up not being super helpful. I‚Äôm planning on reaching out to Alejandra (she‚Äôs our local Excel expert at NAH) to see if she has any advice for what I‚Äôm doing wrong. Unfortunately I don‚Äôt have Excel on my personal laptop so I might be doing longer days in the office to have time to work on an NAH computer containing Excel. </p>

			<p>Overall, this coming week will be filled with the beginnings of data analysis finally! I‚Äôm excited but also very nervous‚Ä¶.45 responses is a lot harder to analyze than I would‚Äôve thought ü§£</p>

			<h3 id="my-biggest-obstacle-this-week-3"><span style="color:purple;">My biggest obstacle this week:</span></h3>

			<p>It‚Äôs so hard to even choose! But I‚Äôll go with setting up the transfer of data from SurveyMonkey to Excel. Sadly, only 2 people can have computer access to our SurveyMonkey account, so it‚Äôs very difficult to transfer data from one computer to the next. I would love to be able to see survey results from my computer, but in order to be able to make an Excel spreadsheet from it, I have to do it on the NAH computer. This also means the Excel spreadsheet is only accessible from an NAH computer because we have no way to share it because gmail(and all google products) are blocked by NAH. As I‚Äôm writing this, I realize I could use a flash-drive ü´†‚Ä¶.But anywho, I think all the data is neatly transferred, though additional survey responses unfortunately don‚Äôt auto-upload to the spreadsheet, so that will have to be dealt with somewhere along the way.</p>

			<p>See you next week!</p>

			<h2 id="week6">Let‚Äôs Stop The Bleed: Week 6: April 3rd</h2>
			<p><strong>April 3, 2024 12:00 pm</strong></p>

			<p>Hi everyone, welcome to Week 6!</p>

			<h3 id="heres-an-overview-of-what-i-did-this-week-4"><span style="color:purple;">Here‚Äôs an overview of what I did this week.</span></h3>

			<p>Long story short: Lots of organizing üòÇ</p>

			<p>Last week I thought I was done organizing most of our data into the spreadsheet (SurveyMonkey transfers most of it, but it‚Äôs not neat enough to be useful), but alas I was wrong. I spent a lot of time last week sorting through all the free-response questions and sorting them out based on commonalities between responses. For example, one of our questions was ‚ÄúWhat is the benefit of Stop the Bleed Training programs‚Äù and I sorted all those responses out into the following themes: <strong>Knowledge</strong>, <strong>Good Skill in General</strong>, <strong>Empowerment</strong>, <strong>Self Preparedness</strong>, <strong>Increased Survival Rates</strong>, <strong>Helping others</strong>, <strong>Community Preparedness</strong>, and left an ‚Äúother‚Äù category for various explanations that either didn‚Äôt fall into one of these, or was just an important detail I wanted to save. Most of the responses fell under multiple branches.</p>

			<p>Anywho, I started all these sorting events last week when there were only around 40 responses, and since then we have nearly doubled to 77 responses! This meant that it would be far too much work to manually add in all the added responses to the spreadsheet, so I decided to create a new one from scratch with all the entries. Because I‚Äôm not great at maneuvering around Excel, this meant that all the sorting I had done prior I had to redo because it would be far too much work to try and copy-paste things from the prior document. </p>

			<p>In addition to sorting responses, I began to think of all the separate things I wanted to analyze. This is the list I have made so far, but once I begin to analyze I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll add/remove things.</p>

			<h3 id="heres-my-plan-for-the-following-week-4"><span style="color:purple;">Here‚Äôs my plan for the following week:</span></h3>

			<p>Since I have finally finished organizing my spreadsheet, I plan on fully using PivotTables (I finally got it to work!) to do the analysis on the above list of topics. They will help me make charts, do percentages, and compare two variables against each other. I‚Äôm hoping to make it through at least half of the list, and possibly make changes as to what I see would be more beneficial to analyze. I also plan on meeting with Floye and possibly Alejandra to check in on my thoughts about analysis. </p>

			<h3 id="frustrations-of-the-week"><span style="color:purple;">Frustrations of the Week:</span></h3>

			<ul>
				<li><p>The frustration of reorganizing my categories. It was annoying to see all the responses I had already categorized and having to redo them one by one.</p></li>
				<li><p>Another frustration I had was selecting parts of my spreadsheet for analysis. The way SurveyMonkey puts out the data(or maybe this is just the way Excel is?) makes it impossible to delete columns and rows that you aren‚Äôt using, when it comes to selecting the sheet for PivotTables, you have to make sure there‚Äôs no empty portions included, this meant that I had to very carefully select rows and columns(I eventually gave up and had Sarah do it ü§£).</p></li>
				<li><p>I could NOT figure out how to rename my spreadsheet, I was able to do it at one point, but since then, I have forgotten and I‚Äôve asked SurveyMonkey to make me multiple spreadsheets(it can spit out sheets that specifically only contain charts, or only include individual responses) to test out different features, and they all got named ‚ÄúStop the Bleed Survey‚Äù which was infuriating.</p></li>
			</ul>

			<h2 id="week7">Let‚Äôs Stop The Bleed: Week 7: April 10th</h2>
			<p><strong>April 10, 2024 12:00 pm</strong></p>

			<p>Hi everyone, welcome to Week 7!</p>

			<h3 id="heres-an-overview-of-what-i-did-this-week-5"><span style="color:purple;">Here‚Äôs an overview of what I did this week.</span></h3>

			<p>Lots of analysis!</p>

			<p>If you look back at my prior post I mentioned 13 categories I wanted to analyze. Essentially comparing all the responses for a certain question and cross-analyzing it with other questions to see if there are similarities etc. I made it through all 13 of my list! However, there are still some edits I want to make that I will go back and fix prior to writing my research paper and starting my final presentation. I essentially created a bunch of different charts for each of our questions showcasing various aspects of the responses (I will include some of them in my presentation) but as a result I have around 50 different charts and graphs, so I‚Äôd like to go back and revise some of them. I also met with Alejandra who checked on some of my work, she had lots to say and I haven‚Äôt had the time to fix all of her recommendations but that is on my to-do list for some point.</p>

			<p>I then had a meeting with Floye to go over my progress and how my analysis is going because I‚Äôm starting to feel the stress of analyzing 77 responses ü§£ it‚Äôs certainly more difficult than I assumed going into it. We talked through some of my concerns that I don‚Äôt have quite enough time to analyze everything as deeply as I‚Äôd like. We essentially decided that I was going to focus on the last two questions on our survey (What‚Äôs the benefit of Stop the Bleed programming? and What could we improve with the program?). Though I already have a lot of analysis done on all the other questions, I‚Äôm going to focus my work from now on on these two questions. </p>

			<p>So after this meeting I started gathering all these responses and re-sorting them into categories (it became an absolute mess on my spreadsheet with too many responses, many answers fitting in multiple categories, etc). I decided to take this part of my analysis back to google docs which I‚Äôm much more familiar and comfortable with. I essentially picked categories (I‚Äôll share them at some point, but they‚Äôre not completely set in stone yet) and looked through every response in the Excel sheet and wrote them down in the google document. This will be greatly helpful in helping me work from home as well because I didn‚Äôt have access to any of our data from Excel. Fortunately none of our responses have any sensitive information so there‚Äôs no issues with having it removed from the office environment. Anywho, now I have everything neatly sorted into my google document, which has made it so much easier to identify similarities in my data. This will help me when making my final recommendations to the Stop the Bleed instructors. Additionally, I made sub-categories for each of my main categories. For example I had a category named ‚ÄúKnowledge‚Äù as one of the benefits of training programs, this had 40 total responses, so I split them into subcategories of ‚ÄúGeneral Knowledge‚Äù versus ‚ÄúSkill Attainment‚Äù. </p>

			<h3 id="heres-my-plan-for-the-following-week-5"><span style="color:purple;">Here‚Äôs my plan for the following week:</span></h3>

			<p>I‚Äôm planning to finish up my analysis on the last 2 questions of the survey. I have everything pretty well laid-out already so it shouldn‚Äôt be much work to quantify everything.</p>

			<p>I‚Äôd also like to take a start on writing my research paper. I‚Äôm hoping to at least get an Introduction, and Methods section. I‚Äôm hoping this process will be pretty similar to my proposal because I think I finally got the hang of that after multiple drafts of it. I want to wait on including any Analysis in the paper because I want to consult with Alejandra, Floye, and Shawn before anything gets too far astray. </p>

			<p>If I have any extra time I‚Äôd also like to look back at my Excel sheet and make edits to the charts based off Alejandra‚Äôs advice.</p>

			<h3 id="frustrations-of-the-week-1"><span style="color:purple;">Frustrations of the Week:</span></h3>

			<p>I messed something up with my spreadsheet ü§£. One minute all my PivotTables worked, the next it told me they all had errors because my data was written incorrectly or something or other. I desperately tried to click the back button, but it was too late üò≠. I contacted Alejandra in an absolute panic because I had spent at least an hour trying to figure out what I did wrong. Thankfully she figured it out and was able to fix everything for me and even managed to make it look much neater!</p>

			<h2 id="week8">Let‚Äôs Stop The Bleed: Week 8: April 17th</h2>
			<p><strong>April 17, 2024 12:00 pm</strong></p>

			<p>Hi everyone, welcome to Week 8!</p>

			<h3 id="heres-an-overview-of-what-i-did-this-week-6"><span style="color:purple;">Here‚Äôs an overview of what I did this week.</span></h3>

			<p>Lots of planning, organizing, and writing my research paper.</p>

			<p>At the start of the week, I decided I was going to plan out my research paper(this is my final product for this project) as well as get started on planning my slide-show presentation. I made 7 google documents dedicated to writing my research paper. They were labeled, ‚Äú<strong>Organizing</strong>, <strong>Introduction</strong>, <strong>Methodology/Materials</strong>, <strong>Results</strong>, <strong>Discussion</strong>, <strong>Conclusion</strong>, and <strong>Abstract</strong>‚Äù. I then decided to do a little bit more research on how to write a research paper, because though I‚Äôve read many throughout this whole process, I didn‚Äôt feel confident in writing one myself. I used these articles to help me format everything, be able to see examples, and be able to make this as professional as possible. (these articles aren‚Äôt ‚Äúscientific‚Äù but they are helpful for what I need them for)</p>

			<p>I then made the following collapsible Headings in each of my google documents: Format, What to Include, Examples, Sections for each portion of that section of the research paper, and Complete. I‚Äôll explain what each of these sections mean below using my ‚ÄúIntroduction‚Äù google document as an example: (I also included a picture of what my Google document looks like with all the sections collapsed)</p>

			<img src="kei-sieben/week-8.jpg">

			<p><strong>Format:</strong> This gives me an example of how to format a section. For example for the introduction I had that I should center my title, have multiple paragraphs double spaced, with references cited</p>

			<p><strong>What to include:</strong> This gives me an idea of the important things to include in this section. For example, in the introduction I need to provide context about the topic, state the need for my work, indicate what I have done as my task, and preview the remainder of my paper.</p>

			<p><strong>Examples of each section:</strong> This gives me an idea of each of the parts I have to include in this section of the paper. For example, in the introduction I had to have the following sections: <strong>A hook</strong>, <strong>describe the background</strong>, <strong>establish your research problem</strong>, <strong>specify your objective</strong>, <strong>state your main task</strong>, and <strong>map out the paper</strong>. One of the websites I looked at  had really good examples of each of these things, so I plugged those all into my google document. This would come in handy when I wrote my own paper.</p>

			<p><strong>Sections:</strong> Here I put a place for me to write each of the sections such as the hook, background, etc.</p>

			<p><strong>Complete:</strong> This is where I combined everything I wrote in each individual section and put it into one cohesive portion.</p>

			<p>In addition to this, I put a link towards each of the websites I looked at to figure out formatting next to portions of my google document so that I could look back at it if I needed.</p>

			<p>So I spent the first day of this week only focusing on organizing everything out, this made it very manageable to write my research paper. Instead of not knowing where to even start, I just had to write small portions such as ‚ÄúSpecifying my objective‚Äù which made the process so much simpler. In addition to this, I looked at Ms. Cohen‚Äôs sheet of things to include in the presentation, I began to kind of plan out what each of my slides was going to include. I left this mostly open-ended, my research paper will make it much easier to sort everything out and have a more exact plan on what I‚Äôm including in my presentation.</p>

			<p>I then spent the rest of the week working on my research paper. I worked primarily from home so the Methods section, and Results section were left pretty empty for now. Essentially, all of my data is on the NAH computers, so trying to remember how I decided to categorize all my data was very difficult. In addition to that, I didn‚Äôt really know off the top of my head what the results were for everything, so that‚Äôs something I have to go back and fix this week. </p>

			<h3 id="heres-my-plan-for-the-following-week-6"><span style="color:purple;">Here‚Äôs my plan for the following week:</span></h3>

			<p>I will be trying to finish up my first draft of the research paper. I only really need to talk about the methods I used for sorting the data, add in graphs of all the data from the PivotTables I created in Excel, state what the final results were, and analyze that. I‚Äôm hoping I can show all this to some of my advisors and get started in the revision process.</p>

			<p>In addition, I‚Äôd like to start working on my final slideshow presentation, now that I‚Äôm very familiar with what‚Äôs in my research paper, I‚Äôll be better able to figure out exactly what I want to put into the presentation</p>

			<h3 id="frustrations-of-the-week-2"><span style="color:purple;">Frustrations of the Week:</span></h3>

			<p>This week wasn‚Äôt very frustrating! It was however a very work-filled week, trying to maintain my sanity while doing much more work than I had prior was very difficult. Until now, I was only working on analysis, which required me to be in the office, so when I got home I didn‚Äôt have to think about my project as much. However, I can do most of my work from home now, so my work-life balance is becoming more difficult to maintain.</p>

			<h2 id="week9">Let‚Äôs Stop The Bleed: Week 9: April 24th</h2>
			<p><strong>April 24, 2024 12:00 pm</strong></p>

			<p>Hi everyone, welcome to Week 9!</p>

			<h3 id="heres-an-overview-of-what-i-did-this-week-7"><span style="color:purple;">Here‚Äôs an overview of what I did this week.</span></h3>

			<p>Things are slowly wrapping up!</p>

			<p>This week I finished up my research paper! There‚Äôs a few things I need to add before I dive deep into revisions(and formatting): my abstract, inter-rater reliability testing, acknowledgments, and references. But these shouldn‚Äôt take longer than a total of 30 minutes.</p>

			<p>In addition, Sarah was working on something called ‚Äúinter-rater reliability testing‚Äù this week. Essentially this measures how reliably we can sort different responses into the same categories. Back when I first started my analysis, I categorized the last two questions into different labels. However, categorizing is not entirely reliable, there are responses that could fit into multiple labels, etc. This gives our research a little bit more credibility(especially if it reveals that we categorized similarly). </p>

			<p>I‚Äôm sure Sarah will talk a little bit more about inter-rater reliability, but here‚Äôs a bit about the process: I already made categories, and organized each of our responses into them(I also organized other questions about what people bought, and occupation, but we focused on the last two questions for inter-rater reliability). I then made a google document with all my categories, a description of what each category meant to me, and a randomized list of all the responses. Then Sarah went into this google document and began sorting everything just like I did at the beginning of my research. </p>

			<p>In addition to my research paper and inter-rater reliability, I started working on our presentation. Sarah and I will be doing a joint-presentation, so I decided to really organize everything before we start actually making our slides so there‚Äôs no overlap or anything. Ms. Cohen gave us some very specific slide requirements so I made a list of all of those and assigned them out between the two of us. Sarah‚Äôs work was primarily survey creation, survey distribution, and a whole bunch of organization, while mine was more ‚Äúresearchy‚Äù, so we decided she‚Äôd do much of the beginning introduction part, introducing Stop the Bleed and the importance of this project. While my portion goes more into the data, and the process of analyzing the data. </p>

			<p>Because I exhibit major panic about this presentation, I decided to also make all my slides (they still need a bit of work, but they‚Äôre all there!) I‚Äôm also hoping to start practicing my portion this week while Sarah works on her slides. Then we can hopefully run through the presentation together many times before presenting.</p>

			<h3 id="heres-my-plan-for-the-following-week-7"><span style="color:purple;">Here‚Äôs my plan for the following week:</span></h3>

			<p>This week Sarah and I will be finishing up inter-rater reliability testing. As soon as she‚Äôs done sorting everything, there‚Äôs a bunch of calculations that can be done to test essentially how good our categories were. It gives a measure of replicability, a lot can change based on how people decide to categorize data, especially if people don‚Äôt agree which categories certain responses would fit into. Hopefully we will have good results with this, we definitely should have done it a while back so that edits can be made, but we‚Äôre getting near the end of our research soon. As soon as that‚Äôs all done, I need to go back and put that into the methodology portion of my research paper.</p>

			<p>I‚Äôm also planning to start editing my research paper. Editing always seems like a never-ending process which is why I tried to be proactive about getting it done well before the end of our project. I‚Äôm planning on editing one section of my paper each day for the next week(there‚Äôs 7 sections so it works out perfectly).</p>

			<p>I also need to work on my presentation. I have all the information I want to talk about on each of my slides, but I want to simplify them down for easier consumption(this just helps me while I‚Äôm trying to remember what each of my slides is dedicated to). I also decided to include all of my charts from my research paper into the slideshow, I‚Äôm not planning on showing all of them, but I‚Äôd like to put them at the end in case I get any questions regarding any of them. As a result, I‚Äôd like to choose which ones I do want to include in the main part of my presentation.</p>

			<h3 id="difficulties-of-the-week"><span style="color:purple;">Difficulties of the Week:</span></h3>

			<p>I‚Äôm really struggling with the urge to ‚Äúpre-crastinate‚Äù. Presentations and final products are due soon, and I definitely struggle with the urge for it to be the best I can make it, so I keep trying to finish everything sooner than it probably needs to be done. This results in me working very long hours and I‚Äôll be finished earlier than I need to be. Which will then result in me trying to over-practice for the presentation because I have a bunch of extra time to! I‚Äôm trying to slow down and fight the urge to get everything done too quickly, because I know it makes the quality worse as well.</p>

			<p><strong>May 1, 2024 12:00 pm</strong></p>

			<p>Hi everyone, welcome to Week 10!</p>

			<h3 id="heres-an-overview-of-what-i-did-this-week-8"><span style="color:purple;">Here‚Äôs an overview of what I did this week.</span></h3>

			<p>Research paper tings and final presentation!</p>

			<p><span style="color:purple;"><strong>Slides:</strong></span> Sarah and I finished up our slideshow presentation which took more time than I originally thought. Essentially most of our slides already existed prior to this week but were filled with more information than needed to be so that we could remember everything we wanted to talk about. We transferred all the important information to the ‚Äúpresenter notes‚Äù and just kept a few bullet points on each slide. There were also a bunch of slides that I noted were going to have pictures of various things, and I inserted those when we went into the office(I needed to take pictures of our data on the hospital computers). Sarah also found the perfect template for our project(it‚Äôs got blood cells on it!!) so she transferred everything from our original boring slides to the new template. We also ran through the presentation a couple times in the office while trying not to be too distracting to everyone around us ü§£. The first few rounds we just read off the presenter slides and also timed how long each slide took us in case we needed to take anything out. The original plan was that we would have a bunch more slides than we thought we needed so we could scrap later, but it turned out that we had just enough time for everything so we kept it mostly as is. </p>

			<p><span style="color:purple;"><strong>Research paper:</strong></span> I had a meeting where I got a bunch of feedback from Floye and Julie about formatting and just general editing. I haven‚Äôt gotten started on those yet because I‚Äôve been focusing on our slides for our practice presentation with the senior project committee. A lot of my feedback focused on my introduction and how detailed it should be, what doesn‚Äôt need to be included, and making sure my results section flows together nicely. My discussion and conclusion sections could also be somewhat combined with a few added notes in the conclusion instead. After our practice with the senior project committee I‚Äôll have a bit more time to go back and focus on all of these edits.</p>

			<h3 id="heres-my-plan-for-the-following-week-8"><span style="color:purple;">Here‚Äôs my plan for the following week:</span></h3>

			<p>My plan for this next week is just going to be get everything ready for the big day! We‚Äôre nearly at the end of this project so no more last minute analysis or anything just getting everything presentation ready and having my research paper as good as it can be. It will not be published as-is anyways so it just needs to be easily followable for Floye to make edits to it later on. </p>

			<h3 id="frustrations-of-the-week-3"><span style="color:purple;">Frustrations of the Week:</span></h3>

			<p>Nothing majorly frustrating now, technology was my biggest problem throughout this project, but currently we‚Äôre working on google slides and google docs(our presentation will be converted to PowerPoint but it was easier to work on it together on slides) which I‚Äôm very used to! I think the biggest difficulty is that because we are doing a combined presentation we need to practice it together so we can‚Äôt practice at ungodly hours where I‚Äôd normally practice if I was doing it individually. I am practicing my slides individually as well but it‚Äôs more difficult to get a sense of time constraints when I‚Äôm skipping Sarah‚Äôs slides.</p>

			<h2 id="conclusion">Let‚Äôs Stop The Bleed: Conclusory Post: May 6th</h2>
			<p><strong>May 6, 2024 12:00 pm</strong></p>

			<p>Hi everyone, welcome to the conclusion post!</p>

			<p>This post is going to be earlier than my typical Wednesday at noon posting schedule(it feels so wrong to post early!! It became a very nice habit for me to write blog posts Monday afternoons and post them for Wednesday at noon. It also looks very satisfying when I look at my list of blog posts haha) because I wanted to be able to post prior to my presentation time.</p>

			<h3 id="quick-summary-of-this-past-week"><span style="color:purple;">Quick summary of this past week:</span></h3>

			<p>This week wasn‚Äôt especially crazy, I went through my presentation multiple times, making some last minute edits and just practicing enough to feel confident, but not too much to start to get frustrated about all of it. I also made last-minute edits on my research paper. I‚Äôm not worried about it being too perfect but I also want it to be the best I can make it considering the time-constraints of this project. All of my content was complete by last week, so I primarily worked on making it look professional. My biggest problem turned out to be that it looked great in a page-less format! But as soon as you make it into a pdf, page breaks make it look horrible, so I tried not to put too much effort into fixing all of the ugly page breaks.</p>

			<h3 id="things-i-will-be-doing-after-our-presentation"><span style="color:purple;">Things I will be doing after our presentation:</span></h3>

			<p>Though my work for BASIS will be over after our presentations on Monday, I still want to collect all of my information and thoughts for the hospital to use after I‚Äôm gone. This includes giving them my research paper, explaining how I used my spreadsheet in case they want to go back and do more analysis on it, and giving Floye our inter-rater reliability results(I didn‚Äôt include this in my research paper, but I know it‚Äôs something she‚Äôs considering using).</p>

			<h3 id="concluding-thoughts-conclusions-reflections"><span style="color:purple;">Concluding thoughts, conclusions, reflections:</span></h3>

			<p>It‚Äôs crazy how fast all this time has gone by! I remember writing my proposal back in 2023 and second-guessing whether I was even capable of doing this project. Now I‚Äôm sitting here wishing this project wasn‚Äôt already finished!</p>

			<p>So a quick conclusion and summary of the actual content that I researched. I came to 3 main conclusions: We need to add supplemental materials/emphasize ones already in existence on the Stop the Bleed website, we need to get more instructors so that this can be rolled out to more people than we currently have the capacity for, and we need to test people‚Äôs actual skills not just their opinions about the training during further research (prior research focused more on this, and showed that changes DO need to be made, whereas my research simply showed that people really like the program and didn‚Äôt necessarily FEEL like things needed to be changed). I go into this more in my paper if anyone is interested in receiving more depth.</p>

			<p>Now onto what I discovered personally. I enjoyed so many aspects of this project, and the things I was scared about turned out to be some of my favorite parts. I‚Äôve never been much of a writer so writing a blog post every week, and writing a research paper seemed a little bit daunting. However, I think that‚Äôs the part I enjoyed most, analyzing all of the data turned out to be VERY frustrating, however when it came to writing about all of it I honestly found it very therapeutic. Though I‚Äôm more interested in being involved in medicine in a clinical fashion, I do think I‚Äôm interested in doing research in the future. My current research paper is very rough‚Ä¶.but I hope that I‚Äôll be able to continue to write more papers in the future. I‚Äôd also love to keep my connections with this program and see how it continues to develop in the future, both in Flagstaff and nationally as well.</p>

			<h3 id="thank-you"><span style="color:purple;">Thank you:</span></h3>

			<p>I wanted to offer a big thank you to everyone who helped me with this project: Sarah W, Shawn B, Sedona S, Paula M, Floye B, Trent M, and Alejandra F. This project was truly a collaborative effort, and I think that‚Äôs going to be the major thing I‚Äôm going to remember: I really enjoyed having a lot of support, if I had done any other project I would‚Äôve felt way more alone. I‚Äôd also like to thank all of my fellow hospital interns: Sarah W, Delaney F, Nathan C, Sedona O, and Aiyana W. I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to have as much fun if I was working in the office by myself ü§£.</p>

			<h3 id="final-presentation-date"><span style="color:purple;">Final Presentation date:</span></h3>

			<p>By the time most of you are reading this, it‚Äôll likely be past the final presentation date, but I will be presenting on Monday, May 6th at the McGee Auditorium at the Flagstaff Medical Center. Hope to see you there!</p>

			<h3 id="presentationfinal-product"><span style="color:purple;">Presentation/Final Product:</span></h3>

			<p>Here is a link to both Sarah and I‚Äôs presentation, and my final product (my research paper). It is important to note that my research paper won‚Äôt be published as is (hopefully it‚Äôll get published in some fashion, but no guarantees!) and that this is more of a guide for Floye, Paula, and Shawn when it comes the time to potentially publish. </p>
