    	<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> This survey aims to test how well the average person is able to distinguish between AI-generated compositions and manmade compositions as well as if musical experience is able to facilitate this distinction. It also aims to see if there is any emotional disparity between the music created by AI and the music created by a human.</p>

    	    <h2>Main Survey</h2>

    	    <p><b>Please make sure to read ALL instructions. The survey should take around 15-20 minutes. If you have any trouble navigating the survey, feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:edwardanwang+spsvy@gmail.com">edwardanwang+spsvy@gmail.com</a>. The form will close at 11:59 PM on May 1st. Thank you again for your participation!</b></p>

			<p><b>How the main survey questions will work:</b> You will be presented with ten questions covering various musical genres spanning different periods of time. Each question includes a 15-second audio clip from a human composition belonging to its respective genre. Beneath each clip, you will find three additional audio clips: one continuing the original composition, one generated by AI, and one composed by a human. The order of the clips will be randomized for each question. Your task is to select the audio clip that you think was generated by AI.</p>

			<p><b>How the emotional response questions will work:</b> For each set of four audio clips, you will be asked to rate each audio clip based on how happy/sad it made you on a scale of 1 to 5 in two separate questions. Selecting 1 means that the audio clip did not make you happy/sad (little to no emotional response), while selecting 5 means that the audio clip made you feel extremely happy/sad (extreme emotional response). If you aren't fully sure how to rate your emotional response, feel free to use the emojis to gauge your emotional response to the music.</p>
