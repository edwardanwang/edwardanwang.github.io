        <p>It started of very well, but the further I got into the show, the more filler there was, making the rest of the anime a bit more boring. Even though that happened, the anime was still pretty good, though I found none of the main characters very likeable. Naruto is annoying, Sakura is useless, and Sasuke is absolutely retarded. My favorite characters would probably be Kakashi or Haku. In the end, I think that all in all, that anime was pretty good, and I am not looking forward to Naruto Shipp&#363;den.</p>

        <p>This was a wonderful anime. It was full of action and twists and surprise that were woven together intricately and interestingly. The only thing I didn't like about Seven Deadly Sins was that it felt somewhat rushed, but I seriously enjoyed this anime. I am very excited for the new season. Again, Elizabeth seems somewhat useless and weak, and her Apostles' Eye doesn't always seem to do what it is supposed to do. I would like to see more Diane x King action because they are such a cute couple! :D</p>

        <p>This anime started out well, but it became more of a romance anime the further in I went, although I should've expected that with a name like <b>Love</b>, Chunibyo, and Other Delusions. I did want to see Shinka to be proven as the legitimate Morisummer, but I never got that satisfaction, with Dekomori continuing to denounce her claims to have written the Mabinogion. I do have to say I have agree with Toka, Rikka's sister. Rikka can't grow up continuing the way she is, and I do believe Chunibyo is <b>EXTREMELY</b> embarassing. If I ever met someone like that, I would probably have committed suicide.</p>

        <p>This anime was brilliant. I love the twist on the poor person in rich society clich&#233;. Each character has different personalities that blend so well in the Host Club. I found it very enjoyable and hilarious to watch. I definitely wish there were more episodes. I also enjoyed the rich person questions commoner objects clich&#233;. Tamaki, Hikaru, and Kaoru are all hilarious to watch, and I enjoy the shifting focus between the characters. Definite 5 out of 5.</p>

        <p>I loved this anime and its interesting concept. I enjoyed all the thrill from the show. I loved the inclusion of interesting technology, such as the GPS bullets and the Masks, and the motivations and story just connect so well. Many questions are answered as the plot progresses, and continuous twists make the plot interesting to watch. I was definitely hooked, and the concept and plot were definitely well construct. Hiroyasu Aoki, give yourself a big round of applause.

        <p>Dude... This hurt me in the feels really hard. Everything was fine for the first eleven episodes, but then it got into <b>hemorrhagic shock</b>, and that made me cry so hard. There was so much death and destruction that it was literally impossible to cry. I don't know where Kouhai went, but I think she's dead now, and literally everyone's dead. The show left me feeling satisfied in a sad way, and now I definitely need to see season 2. The idea of anthropomorphic cells was fairly original, and it was so interesting learning biology through anime, although it does pose some insignificant questions, like whether these anthropomorphic cells have their own immune system, and so on so forth. Definitely recommend if you don't cry as much as me (literally everyone).</p>

        <p>This was a somewhat fun anime to watch. I did think it was interesting to see a kuudere-tsundere relationship, although it is used quite a bit in other shows. Again, I didn't like the romance aspect, and I do think that the love triangle that is commonly used was used here (the one where she meets a guy at school, but then her childhood friend reappears, this one being a kuudere-tsundere-deredere triangle). I wouldn't exactly be excited for a second season, but I did enjoy the plot of the story, and I have to say that I didn't regret watching this anime.</p>

        <p>I feel like this show is definitely underrated by many people. While it does include the magical girl plot, it is able to twist it, making the show darker and more interesting than other magical girl plots like Glitter Force. Korea definitely knows what they're doing. I was definitely invested in the many storylines offered, such as the Ari-Suha-Min plotline, the Shuel plotline (which was my favorite to see, with her trying to destroy the Problem Solving Club inside out), and the Trump-

          Mao plotline. I definitely hope that the second season gets subbed soon because I love this show so much. Definitely a 10/10. :)</p>

          <br>★★★★☆
        </h3>
        <p>I really enjoyed this anime. The characters are quirky and unique, and there were many ridiculous parts that I laughed at. It was very interesting watching Nozaki work on his manga with Chiyo and others. I enjoyed Yuzuki Seo for her CrAzY attitude, although I did want to see Wakamatsu's face when he finds out Lorelei = Yuzuki Seo. I was interested through and through, enjoying the more slice-of-life-ish moments. Although the ending did leave me a bit dissatisfied, I have to say that it was expected since Nozaki is very blind to the fact that Chiyo has a crush on her. All in all, great anime. :)</p>

          <br>★★★☆☆
        </h3>
        <p>This anime was mediocre. It did inspire me to practice my piano more, but the story seemed to be lacking something. It was worth the time, but it continued to feel like something was lacking in the story. The whole of the second season obcessantly detailed the Chopin competition, and it did become progressively boring. The piano playing was very beautiful, but the whole "Kai is playing different accents and dynamics" doesn't really check out; His piano sounds really similar to the other contestants. I also feel that Pang Wei was an excuse for Japan to make fun of China, although that might stem from my personal bias. I was left unsatisfied by the ending, but I believe that had the anime had more money in their budget, they could've pulled off this anime better.</p>
