      My initials are <b>EW</b>. I'm a big fan of anime. This site was created for the sole purpose of tracking the animes that I have watched. I have two friends whose initials are <b>LS</b> and <b>NN</b> that have watched <b>A LOT</b> of anime, and I am determined to beat them. <b>LS</b> has watched around 210, and <b>NN</b> has watched around 180, and they are in a sort of battle of who can watch more anime, and I'm determined to beat both of them, although it will probably take me forever, and they'll also be watching anime too. I don't know how fast I'll have to finish anime, but you can be sure this list will be continuously updated.
