    <h1>About The Person Who Made This</h1>
    <div id="floater">
      <div id="floated"><img src="Images/Profile Picture/Saiki Kusuo.jpg" id="profile"></div>
      My initials are <b>EW</b>. I'm a big fan of anime. This site was created for the sole purpose of tracking the animes that I have watched. I have two friends whose initials are <b>LS</b> and <b>NN</b> that have watched <b>A LOT</b> of anime, and I am determined to beat them. <b>LS</b> has watched around 210, and <b>NN</b> has watched around 180, and they are in a sort of battle of who can watch more anime, and I'm determined to beat both of them, although it will probably take me forever, and they'll also be watching anime too. I don't know how fast I'll have to finish anime, but you can be sure this list will be continuously updated. This mostly started in the heat of the COVID-19 epidemic and through my own boredom, but with school slowly approaching, the updates will probably start to dwindle. I also have a ton of interest in coding languages, mostly <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> (which was used to compile this website), <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> (which makes the website look <span>PRETTY</span>, although that's questionable), and <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> (which makes the website interactive, although that is also questionable). I will probably add more pages to the site as the list goes on, and I might even add a small log to this page about the latest changes to the page, but for now, it's probably going to stay very simple, although I do want to make some changes to the Anime Index site for <abbr title="The site isn't centered">obvious reasons.</abbr> I'm hoping to get other parts of the pages done, but for now, my main focus will be linking new pages to each of the Anime Index links. If you're confused about where the Anime Index page is, you can click <a href="animeindex.html">here</a>.

    <h2>Commonly Asked Questions</h2>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Why?</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>You ever get stuck in the middle of a worldwide pandemic, restricted from going outside out of fear of being killed by an evil virus, later getting so divulged into anime and aeni that you need to track how much sh*t you've been watching, leading to you utilizing your skill in coding languages to build a website to kill time?</p>
      <div id="confirmdiv">
        <button class="confirm" onclick="aboutConfirm(1);">Yes</button>
        <button class="confirm" onclick="aboutConfirm(2);">No</button>
      </div>
    </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">How often do you update this page?</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Every day or two. I would like to upload more, but I other things to do to, like piano and biking to my friends house. I also am a little angry at Github for the whole <abbr title="PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> failure, where I tried to make my website a little more snazzy, but it backfired because Github doesn't support PHP. That seriously frustrated me, and I also had to delete a large ton of this page.</p>
    </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Can I add anime to this site? Can I add reviews?</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>No. This is my page, and adding reviews from other people would seriously undermine the whole point. If you'd like something to do here, maybe you could actually dig <b>into</b> the code. You might find something. :P</p>
      <!--
        sO you actually came here! if yoU're looking for the secret, i'll just tell you there is a secRet site on this page. extrA points if you caN contact me the exact url. Maybe I'll see you there!
      -->
    </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Why do some of the links not work?</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>I'm actually planning on using a sh*t ton of JS fill-in in order to let me code most of the anime index page. It will seriously take me forever, and I promise you that it <b>WILL</b> take me a month or two. The site will continue to be worked on well into the 2020 - 2021 school year. I am determined to lead this website to fruition, but it had definitely not been easy, so please contact me if you find any bugs or glitches. This is definitely going to be a long project.</p>
