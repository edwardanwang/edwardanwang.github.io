## Website
This website was made by Edward Wang for personal purposes. It's mostly about anime, but I'm probably going to host other stupid stuff because I only have one website I get to code, and it's this one :D

## Them Links Tho...
This website's links actually don't work yet since I haven't coded the websites for the links (Tragically). Be patient though, because I am working to get those up as soon as possible. So don't freak out.
Another note, the links on the Anime Index don't work because they are not supposed to work, they're just there to make the website work and look a bit cooler.
